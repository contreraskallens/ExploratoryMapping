2		2006	poldrack ra	can cognitive processes be inferred from neuroimaging data	trends in cognitive sciences	there is much interest currently in using functional neuroimaging techniques to understand better the nature of cognition one particular practice that has become common is reverse inference by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region such inferences are not deductively valid but can still provide some information using a  analysis of the brainmap neuroimaging database i characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest i argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak

109		1993	shastri l ajjanagadde v	from simple associations to systematic reasoning  a connectionist representation of rules variables and dynamic bindings using temporal synchrony	behavioral and brain sciences	human agents draw a variety of inferences effortlessly spontaneously and with remarkable efficiency  as though these inferences were a reflexive response of their cognitive apparatus furthermore these inferences are drawn with reference to a large body of background knowledge this remarkable human ability seems paradoxical given the complexity of reasoning reported by researchers in artificial intelligence it also poses a challenge for cognitive science and  neuroscience how can a system of simple and slow neuronlike elements represent a large body of systemic knowledge and perform a range of inferences with such speed we describe a  model that takes a step toward addressing the cognitive science challenge and resolving the artificial intelligence paradox we show how a connectionist network can encode millions of facts and rules involving nary predicates and variables and perform a class of inferences in a few hundred milliseconds efficient reasoning requires the rapid representation and propagation of dynamic bindings our model which we refer to as shruti achieves this by representing 1 dynamic bindings as the synchronous firing of appropriate nodes 2 rules as interconnection patterns that direct the propagation of rhythmic activity and 3 longterm facts as temporal patternmatching subnetworks the model is consistent with recent neurophysiological evidence that synchronous activity occurs in the brain and may play a representational role in neural information processing the model also makes specific psychologically significant predictions about the nature of reflexive reasoning it identifies constraints on the form of rules that may participate in such reasoning and relates the capacity of the working memory underlying reflexive reasoning to biological parameters such as the lowest frequency at which nodes can sustain synchronous oscillations and the coarseness of synchronization

187		1992	murre jmj phaf rh wolters g	calm  categorizing and learning module	neural networks	a new procedure calm  categorizing and learning module is introduced for unsupervised learning in modular neural networks  the work described addresses a number of problems in connectionist modeling such as lack of speed lack of stability inability to learn either with or without supervision and the inability to both discriminate between and generalize over patterns  calm is a single module that can be used to construct larger networks  a calm module consists of pairs of excitatory representation and inhibitory vetonodes and an arousalnode  because of the fixed internal wiring pattern of a module the arousalnode is sensitive to the novelty of the input pattern  the activation of the arousalnode determines two psychologically motivated types of learning operating in the module  elaboration learning which implies a high learning rate and the distribution of nonspecific random activations in the module and activation learning which has only base rate learning without random activations  the learning rule used is a modified version of a rule described by grossberg  the workings of calm networks are illustrated in a number of simulations  it is shown that a calm module quickly reaches a categorization even with new patterns  though categorization and learning are relatively fast compared to other models calm modules do not suffer from excessive plasticity  they are also shown to be capable of both discriminating between and generalizing over patterns  when presented with a pattern set exceeding the number of representationnodes similar patterns are assigned to the same node  multimodular simulations showed that with supervised learning an average of 16 presentations sufficed to learn the exor function  moreover an unsupervised learning version of the mcclelland and rumelhart model successfully simulated a word superiority effect  it is concluded that the incorporation of psychologically and biologically plausible structural and functional characteristics like modularity unsupervised competitive learning and a novelty dependent learning rate may contribute to solving some of the problems often encountered in connectionist modeling

201		1998	mesulam mm	from sensation to cognition	brain	sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture of cognition this process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy which includes the primary sensory upstream unimodal downstream unimodal heteromodal paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral cortex connections from one zone to another are reciprocal and allow higher synaptic levels to exert a feedback topdown influence upon earlier levels of processing each cortical area provides a nexus for the convergence of afferents and divergence of efferents the resultant synaptic organization supports parallel as well as serial processing and allows each sensory event to initiate multiple cognitive and behavioural outcomes upstream sectors of unimodal association areas encode basic features of sensation such as colour motion form and pitch more complex contents of sensory experience such as objects faces wordforms spatial locations and sound sequences become encoded within downstream sectors of unimodal areas by groups of coarsely tuned neurons the highest synaptic levels of sensoryfugal processing are occupied by heteromodal paralimbic and limbic cortices collectively known as transmodal areas the unique role of these areas is to bind multiple unimodal and other transmodal areas into  but integrated multimodal representations transmodal areas in the midtemporal cortex wernicke area the hippocampalentorhinal complex and the posterior parietal cortex provide critical gateways for transforming perception into recognition wordforms into meaning scenes and events into experiences and spatial locations into targets for exploration all cognitive processes arise from analogous associative transformations of similar sets of sensory inputs the differences in the resultant cognitive operation are determined by the anatomical and physiological properties of the transmodal node that acts as the critical gateway for the dominant transformation interconnected sets of transmodal nodes provide anatomical and  epicentres for largecale neurocognitive networks in keeping with the principles of selectively  processing each epicentre of a largecale network displays a relative specialization for a specific behavioural component of its principal neurospychological domain the destruction of transmodal epicentres causes global impairments such as multimodal anemia neglect and amnesia whereas their selective disconnection from relevant unimodal areas elicits modalitypecific impairments such as prosopagnosia pure word blindness and categorypecific anemias the human brain contains at least five anatomically distinct networks the network for spatial awareness is based on transmodal epicentres in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields the language network on epicentres in wernicke and broca areas the explicit memoryemotion network on epicentres in the hippocampalentorhinal complex and the amygdala the faceobject recognition network on epicentres in the midtemporal and temporopolar cortices and the working memoryexecutive function network on epicentres in the lateral prefrontal cortex and perhaps the posterior parietal cortex individual sensory modalities give rise to streams of processing directed to transmodal nodes belonging to each of these networks the fidelity of sensory channels is actively protected through approximately four synaptic levels of sensoryfugal processing the modalitypecific cortices at these four synaptic levels encode the most veridical representations of experience attentional motivational and emotional modulations including those related to working memory noveltyeeking and mental imagery become increasingly more pronounced within downstream components of unimodal areas where they help to create a highly edited subjective version of the world the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in these attentional and emotional modulations and allows neural responses to reflect the significance rather than the surface properties of sensory events additional modulatory influences are exerted by the cholinergic and monoaminergic pathways of the ascending reticular activating system working memory one of the most prominent manifestations of prefrontal cortex activity prolongs the neural impact of environmental and mental events in a way that enriches the texture of consciousness the synaptic architecture of largecale networks and the manifestations of working memory noveltyeeking behaviours and mental imagery collectively help to loosen the rigid stimulusresponse bonds that dominate the behaviour of lower animal species this phylogenetic trend has helped to shape the unique properties of human consciousness and to induce the emergence of secondorder ymbolic representations related to language through the advent of language and the resultant ability to communicate abstract concepts the critical pacemaker for human cognitive development has shifted from the extremely slow process of structural brain evolution to the much more rapid one of  computations where each individual intelligence can become incorporated into an interactive lattice that promotes the transgenerational transfer and accumulation of knowledge

531		1994	wagenaar rc vanemmerik rea	dynamics of pathological gait	human movement science	this paper is aimed at applying tools of  systems theory to the evaluation and treatment of movement disorders a key notion in this approach is that qualitative changes in movement coordination emerge spontaneously as a result of unspecific and continuous changes in control parameters our research on the dynamics of gait indicates that gradually varying walking velocity as a control parameter results in systematic changes in the frequency and phase relations of arm and leg movements as well as in the phase relation of pelvic and thoracic rotation within the bipedal walking mode identification of these intrinsic dynamics of gait enables the classification of pathological coordination patterns stability and the ability to make transitions between patterns adaptability are important issues in the evaluation of movement disorders for exercise therapy this implies that the patient must learn to tap the appropriate control parameter in order to facilitate spontaneous emergence of the desired coordination pattern the use of perceptual information in the form of external auditory and visual rhythms can have positive influences on hemiplegic and parkinsonian gait by synchronizing the movements of the body segments the effects of rhythmic exercises are however very sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the rhythms manipulated it is concluded that a systematic investigation of the role of perceptual control variables is a necessary prerequisite to understand and treat movement disorders

763		2013	wilson ad golonka s	 cognition is not what you think it is	frontiers in psychology	the most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is the theory that cognition is  like all good ideas in cognitive science however embodiment immediately came to mean six different things the most common definitions involve the straightforward claim that tates of the body modify states of the mind however the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this if cognition can span the brain body and the environment then the tates of mind of dis cognitive science wont exist to be modified cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory here we outline four key steps that research programs should follow in order to fully engage with the implications of embodiment the first step is to conduct a task analysis which characterizes from a first person perspective the specific task that a perceivingacting cognitive agent is faced with the second step is to identify the taskrelevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve the task these resources can span brain body and environment the third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand the last step is to test the agent performance to confirm that agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3 we explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful examples the outfielder problem and the anotb error and introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of language use  cognition is more than we think it is and we have the tools we need to realize its full potential

829		2008	sinigaglia c	 understanding and motor intentionality	enacting intersubjectivity a cognitive and social perspective on the study of interactions	most of our social interactions rest upon our ability to understand the behavior of others but what is really at the basis of this ability the standard view is that we understand the behavior of others because we are able to read their mind to represent them as individuals endowed with mental states such as beliefs desires and intentions without this mindreading ability the behavior of others would be meaningless for us over the last few years however this view has been undermined by several neurophysiological findings and in particular by the discovery of mirror neurons the functional properties of these neurons indicate that motor and intentional components of action are tightly intertwined suggesting that the basic aspects of intentional understanding can be fully appreciated only on the basis of a motor approach to intentionality this paper has a dual objective to develop this approach in order to account for the crucial role of motor intentionality in action and intention understanding below and before any metarepresentational ability and to shed new light on the ontogeny of mindreading by explaining how the first forms of understanding in infants may be intentional in nature even without presupposing any explicit and deliberate mentalizing
