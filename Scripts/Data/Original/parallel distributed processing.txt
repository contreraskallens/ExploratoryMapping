TI From sensation to cognition
SO BRAIN
AB Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture of cognition. This process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy which includes the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream unimodal, heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral cortex. Connections from one zone to another are reciprocal and allow higher synaptic levels to exert a feedback (top-down) influence upon earlier levels of processing. Each cortical area provides a nexus for the convergence of afferents and divergence of efferents. The resultant synaptic organization supports parallel as well as serial processing, and allows each sensory event to initiate multiple cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Upstream sectors of unimodal association areas encode basic features of sensation such as colour, motion, form and pitch. More complex contents of sensory experience such as objects, faces, word-forms, spatial locations and sound sequences become encoded within downstream sectors of unimodal areas by groups of coarsely tuned neurons. The highest synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing are occupied by heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic cortices, collectively known as transmodal areas. The unique role of these areas is to bind multiple unimodal and other transmodal areas into distributed but integrated multimodal representations. Transmodal areas in the midtemporal cortex, Wernicke's area, the hippocampalentorhinal complex and the posterior parietal cortex provide critical gateways for transforming perception into recognition, word-forms into meaning, scenes and events into experiences, and spatial locations into targets for exploration. All cognitive processes arise from analogous associative transformations of similar sets of sensory inputs. The differences in the resultant cognitive operation are determined by the anatomical and physiological properties of the transmodal node that acts as the critical gateway for the dominant transformation. Interconnected sets of transmodal nodes provide anatomical and computational epicentres for large-scale neurocognitive networks. In keeping with the principles of selectively distributed processing, each epicentre of a large-scale network displays a relative specialization for a specific behavioural component of its principal neurospychological domain. The destruction of transmodal epicentres causes global impairments such as multimodal anemia, neglect and amnesia, whereas their selective disconnection from relevant unimodal areas elicits modality-specific impairments such as prosopagnosia, pure word blindness and category-specific anemias.
   The human brain contains at least five anatomically distinct networks. The network for spatial awareness is based on transmodal epicentres in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields; the language network on epicentres in Wernicke's and Broca's areas; the explicit memory/emotion network on epicentres in the hippocampal-entorhinal complex and the amygdala; the face-object recognition network on epicentres in the midtemporal and temporopolar cortices; and the working memory-executive function network on epicentres in the lateral prefrontal cortex and perhaps the posterior parietal cortex. Individual sensory modalities give rise to streams of processing directed to transmodal nodes belonging to each of these networks. The fidelity of sensory channels is actively protected through approximately four synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing. The modality-specific cortices at these four synaptic levels encode the most veridical representations of experience. Attentional, motivational and emotional modulations, including those related to working memory, novelty-seeking and mental imagery, become increasingly more pronounced within downstream components of unimodal areas, where they help to create a highly edited subjective version of the world. The prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in these attentional and emotional modulations and allows neural responses to reflect the significance rather than the surface properties of sensory events. Additional modulatory influences are exerted by the cholinergic and monoaminergic pathways of the ascending reticular activating system. Working memory, one of the most prominent manifestations of prefrontal cortex activity, prolongs the neural impact of environmental and mental events in a way that enriches the texture of consciousness. The synaptic architecture of large-scale networks and the manifestations of working memory, novelty-seeking behaviours and mental imagery collectively help to loosen the rigid stimulus-response bonds that dominate the behaviour of lower animal species. This phylogenetic trend has helped to shape the unique properties of human consciousness and to induce the emergence of second-order (symbolic) representations related to language. Through the advent of language and the resultant ability to communicate abstract concepts, the critical pacemaker for human cognitive development has shifted from the extremely slow process of structural brain evolution to the much more rapid one of distributed computations where each individual intelligence can become incorporated into an interactive lattice that promotes the transgenerational transfer and accumulation of knowledge.

TI The emotional stroop task and psychopathology
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB Attentional bias is a central feature of many cognitive theories of psychopathology. One of the most frequent methods of investigating such bias has been an emotional analog of the Stroop task. In this task, participants name the colors in which words are printed, and the words vary in their relevance to each theme of psychopathology. The authors review research showing that patients are often slower to name the color of a word associated with concerns relevant to their clinical condition. They address the causes and mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, focusing on J. D. Cohen, K. Dunbar, and J. L. McClelland's (1990) parallel distributed processing model.

TI MODELS OF READING ALOUD - DUAL-ROUTE AND PARALLEL-DISTRIBUTED-PROCESSING
   APPROACHES
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB It has often been argued that various facts about skilled reading aloud cannot be explained by any model unless that model possesses a dual-route architecture (lexical and nonlexical routes from print to speech). This broad claim has been challenged by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989, 1990). Their model has but a single route from print to speech, yet, they contend, it can account for major facts about reading that have hitherto been claimed to require a dual-route architecture. The authors identify 6 of these major facts about reading. The 1-route model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland can account for the first of these but not the remaining 5. Because models with dual-route architectures can explain all 6 of these basic facts about reading, the authors suggest that this remains the viable architecture for any tenable model of skilled reading and learning to read. The dual-route cascaded model, a computational version of the dual-route model, is described.

TI Towards a cognitive neuroscience of consciousness: basic evidence and a
   workspace framework
SO COGNITION
AB This introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical, empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to consciousness can be founded. We isolate three major empirical observations that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework that synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. This framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. An information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the information available to a variety of processes including perceptual categorization, longterm memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. A complete theory of consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. We confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental predictions. Neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.

TI A UNIFIED ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECTS OF DISTINCTIVENESS, INVERSION, AND RACE
   IN FACE RECOGNITION
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY SECTION A-HUMAN
   EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB A framework is outlined in which individual faces are assumed to be encoded as a point in a multidimensional space, defined by dimensions that serve to discriminate faces. It is proposed that such a framework can account for the effects of distinctiveness, inversion, and race on recognition of faces. Two specific models within this framework are identified:  a norm-based coding model, in which faces are encoded as vectors from a population norm or prototype; and a purely exemplar-based model. Both models make similar predictions, albeit in different ways, concerning the interactions between the effects of distinctiveness, inversion and race. These predictions were supported in five experiments in which photographs of faces served as stimuli. The norm-based coding version and the exemplar-based version of the framework cannot be distinguished on the basis of the experiments reported, but it is argued that a multidimensional space provides a useful heuristic framework to investigate recognition of faces. Finally, the relationship between the specific models is considered and an implementation in terms of parallel distributed processing is briefly discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Yeo BT, Krienen FM, Sepulcre J, Sabuncu MR, Lashkari D, Hollinshead M, Roffman JL, Smoller JW, Zollei L, Polimeni JR, Fischl B, Liu H, Buckner RL. The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity. J Neurophysiol 106: 11251165, 2011. First published June 8, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00338.2011.-Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.

TI DISTRIBUTION OF CORTICAL NEURAL NETWORKS INVOLVED IN WORD COMPREHENSION
   AND WORD RETRIEVAL
SO BRAIN
AB Six normal volunteers were studied with positron emission tomography to identify the cortical neural networks that participate in the processing of single words.  Activity-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow were measured consecutively on 6 occasions in each subject, 2 while the subject was at rest and 4 while single word language tasks were being performed.  The data from each subject were standardized for brain shape and size, reconstructed parallel to the intercommissural line, normalized for global flow differences, and then averaged for each activation condition across the 6 subjects.  Significant areas of change in rCBF (P < 0.05, with appropriate Bonferroni corrections) between task and rest conditions were displayed with reference to the coordinates of a standard neuroanatomical atlas.  We have demonstrated that categorical judgements on heard pairs of real words activate neural networks along both superior temporal gyri, but with an anatomical distribution no different from that seen when the subjects listened to nonwords:  the tasks would appear to be very different in cognitive demands but not in terms of the distribution of activation.  However, during a verb generation task that involved thinking of verbs appropriate to heard nouns presented at a slow rate, the only temporal region activated was the left posterior superior temporal association cortex (Wernicke's area).  Further analysis showed that whereas activation in other superior temporal regions, both left and right, correlated with rates of word presentation during the 4 tasks, there was no such correlation in Wernicke's area:  evidence that this site is responsible for more than early acoustic processing.  During verb generation there was also activation of left premotor and prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area and the supplementary motor area).  The supplementary motor area is thought to be involved in the motor planning of speech.  The subjects did not vocalize during the task, and therefore it would appear that the act of retrieving words from semantic memory activates networks concerned with the production of speech sounds.  We conclude that single word comprehension and retrieval activate very different distributed regions of cerebral cortex, with Wernicke's area the only region engaged by both processes and with participation during silent word generation of networks involved in vocalization.

AB Recent functional brain imaging studies suggest that object concepts may be represented, in part, by distributed networks of discrete cortical regions that parallel the organization of sensory and motor systems. In addition, different regions of the left lateral prefrontal cortex, and perhaps anterior temporal cortex, may have distinct roles in retrieving, maintaining and selecting semantic information.

TI Organization of intra-amygdaloid circuitries in the rat: an emerging
   framework for understanding functions of the amygdala
SO TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES
AB The amygdala is located in the medial aspects of the temporal lobe. In spite of the fact that the amygdala has been implicated in a variety of functions, ranging from attention to memory to emotion, it has not attracted neuroscientists to the same extent as its laminated neighbours, in particular the hippocampus and surrounding cortex. However, recently, principles of information processing within the amygdala, particularly in the rat, have begun to emerge from anatomical, physiological and behavioral studies. These findings suggest that after the stimulus enters the amygdala, the highly organized intra-amygdaloid circuitries provide a pathway by which the representation of a stimulus becomes distributed in parallel to various amygdaloid nuclei. As a consequence,the stimulus representation may become modulated by different functional systems, such as those mediating memories from past experience or knowledge about ongoing homeostatic states. The amygdaloid output nuclei, especially the central nucleus, receive convergent information from several other amygdaloid regions and generate behavioral responses that presumably reflect the sum of neuronal activity produced by different amygdaloid nuclei.

TI A model of saccade generation based on parallel processing and
   competitive inhibition
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB During active vision, the eyes continually scan the visual environment using saccadic scanning movements. This target article presents an information processing model for the control of these movements, with some close parallels to established physiological processes in the oculomotor system. Two separate pathways are concerned with the spatial and the temporal programming of the movement. In the temporal pathway there is spatially distributed coding and the saccade target is selected from a "salience map." Both path ways descend through a hierarchy of levels, the lower ones operating automatically. Visual onsets have automatic access to the eye control system via the lower levels. Various centres in each pathway are interconnected via reciprocal inhibition. The model accounts for a number of well-established phenomena in target-elicited saccades: the gap effect, express saccades, the remote distracter effect, and the global effect. High-level control of the pathways in tasks such as visual search and reading is discussed; it operates through spatial selection and search selection, which generally combine in an automated way. The model is examined in relation to data from patients with unilateral neglect.

TI Structure and deterioration of semantic memory: A neuropsychological and
   computational investigation
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB Wernicke (1900, as cited in G. H. Eggert, 1977) suggested that semantic knowledge arises from the interaction of perceptual representations of objects and words. The authors present a parallel distributed processing implementation of this theory, in which semantic representations emerge from mechanisms that acquire the mappings between visual representations of objects and their verbal descriptions. To test the theory, they trained the model to associate names, verbal descriptions, and visual representations of objects. When its inputs and outputs are constructed to capture aspects of structure apparent in attribute-norming experiments, the model provides an intuitive account of semantic task performance. The authors then used the model to understand the structure of impaired performance in patients with selective and progressive impairments of conceptual knowledge. Data from 4 well-known semantic tasks revealed consistent patterns that find a ready explanation in the model. The relationship between the model and related theories of semantic representation is discussed.

TI CORTICAL POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION AND LONG-RANGE LATERAL INTERACTIONS
   REVEALED BY REAL-TIME OPTICAL IMAGING OF MACAQUE MONKEY PRIMARY
   VISUAL-CORTEX
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Processing of retinal images is carried out in the myriad dendritic arborizations of cortical neurons. Such processing involves complex dendritic integration of numerous inputs, and the subsequent output is transmitted to multiple targets by extensive axonal arbors. Thus far, details of this intricate processing remained unexaminable. This report describes the usefulness of real-time optical imaging in the study of population activity and the exploration of cortical dendritic processing. In contrast to single-unit recordings, optical signals primarily measure the changes in transmembrane potential of a population of neuronal elements, including the often elusive subthreshold synaptic potentials that impinge on the extensive arborization of cortical cells.
   By using small visual stimuli with sharp borders and realtime imaging of cortical responses, we found that shortly after its onset, cortical activity spreads from its retinotopic site of initiation, covering an area at least 10 times larger, in upper cortical layers. The activity spreads at velocities from 100 to 250 mu m/msec. Near the V1/V2 border the direct activation is anisotropic and we detected also anisotropic spread; the ''space constant'' for the spread was similar to 2.7 mm parallel to the border and similar to 1.5 mm along the perpendicular axis. In addition, we found cortical interactions between cortical activities evoked by a small ''center stimulus'' and by large ''surround stimuli'' positioned outside the classical receptive field. All of the surround stimuli used suppressed the cortical response to the center stimulus. Under some stimulus conditions iso-orientation suppression was more pronounced than orthogonal-orientation suppression. The orientation dependence of the suppression and its dependency on the size of some specific stimuli indicate that at least part of the center surround inhibitory interaction was of cortical origin.
   The findings reported here raise the possibility that distributed processing over a very large cortical area plays a major role in the processing of visual information by the primary visual cortex of the primate.

TI Multiple neural systems controlling food intake and body weight
SO NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB Discovery of the leptin receptor and its downstream peptidergic pathways has reconfirmed the crucial role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of food intake and energy balance Strategically located in the midst of the mammalian neuraxis, the hypothalamus receives at least three distinct types of relevant information via direct or indirect neural connections as well as hormone receptors and substrate sensors bestowed on hypothalamic neurons. First, the medial and to a lesser extent the lateral hypothalamus receive a rich nux of information pertaining to the internal state of relative energy repletion/depletion. Second, specific hypothalamic nuclei receive information about the behavioral state, such as diurnal clock, physical activity-level, reproductive cycle, developmental stage, as well as imminent (e g fight and flight) and chronic (e.g. infection) stressors, that can potentially impact on short-term availability of fuels and long-term energy balance Third, the hypothalamus, particularly its lateral aspects, receives information from areas in the forebrain involved in the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of sensory representations of the external food space and internal food experience, as well as from the executive forebrain involved in behavior selection and initiation. In addition, rich intrahypothalamic connections facilitate further distribution of incoming information to various hypothalamic nuclei.
   On the other hand, the hypothalamus has widespread neural projections to the same cortical areas it receives inputs, and many hypothalamic neurons are one synapse away from most endocrine systems and from both sympathetic and parasympathetic effector organs involved in the flux, storage, mobilization, and utilization of fuels. It is argued that processing within cortico-limbic areas and communication with hypothalamic areas are particularly important in human food intake control that is more and more guided by cognitive rather than metabolic aspects in the obesigenic environment of affluent societies A distributed neural network for the control of food intake and energy balance consisting of a central processor and several parallel processing loops is hypothesized. Detailed neurochemical, anatomical, and functional analysis of reciprocal connections of the numerous peptidergic neuron populations in the hypothalamus with extrahypothalamic brain areas will be necessary to better understand what hypothalamus, forebrain, and brainstem tell each other and who is in charge under specific conditions of internal and external nutrient availability.

Kliegl, 2002) were to investigate the possibility of spatially distributed processing and to implement a general mechanism for all types of eye movements observed in reading experiments. The authors present an advanced version of SWIFT that integrates properties of the oculomotor system and effects of word recognition to explain many of the experimental phenomena faced in reading research. They propose new procedures for the estimation of model parameters and for the test of the model's performance. They also present a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of the SWIFT model. Finally, within this framework, they present an analysis of the transition from parallel to serial processing.

TI Alterations in memory networks in mild cognitive impairment and
   Alzheimer's disease: An independent component analysis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Memory function is likely subserved by multiple distributed neural networks, which are disrupted by the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease ( AD). In this study, we used multivariate analytic techniques to investigate memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in 52 individuals across the continuum of normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD. Independent component analyses revealed specific memory-related networks that activated or deactivated during an associative memory paradigm. Across all subjects, hippocampal activation and parietal deactivation demonstrated a strong reciprocal relationship. Furthermore, we found evidence of a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI activation across the continuum of impairment. Less impaired MCI subjects showed paradoxical hyperactivation in the hippocampus compared with controls, whereas more impaired MCI subjects demonstrated significant hypoactivation, similar to the levels observed in the mild AD subjects. We found a remarkably parallel curve in the pattern of memory-related deactivation in medial and lateral parietal regions with greater deactivation in less-impaired MCI and loss of deactivation in more impaired MCI and mild AD subjects. Interestingly, the failure of deactivation in these regions was also associated with increased positive activity in a neocortical attentional network in MCI and AD. Our findings suggest that loss of functional integrity of the hippocampal-based memory systems is directly related to alterations of neural activity in parietal regions seen over the course of MCI and AD. These data may also provide functional evidence of the interaction between neocortical and medial temporal lobe pathology in early AD.

TI An ERP study on the time course of emotional face processing
SO NEUROREPORT
AB Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we investigated the time course of facial expression processing in human subjects watching photographs of fearful and neutral faces. Upright fearful faces elicited a frontocentral positivity within 120 ms after stimulus presentation, which was followed by a broadly distributed sustained positivity beyond 250 ms post-stimulus. Emotional expression effects were delayed and attenuated when faces were inverted. In contrast, the face-specific N170 component was completely unaffected by facial expression. We conclude that emotional expression analysis and the structural encoding of faces are parallel processes. Early emotional ERP modulations may reflect the rapid activation of prefrontal areas involved in the analysis of facial expression.

TI An fMRI study of Stroop word-color interference: Evidence for cingulate
   subregions subserving multiple distributed attentional systems
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: The goal of this study was to model the functional connectivity of the neural systems that subserve attention and impulse control. Proper performance of the Stroop Word-Color Interference Task requires both attention and impulse control.
   Methods: Word-color interference was studied in 34 normal adult subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: inter-regional correlation analyses suggested that the anterior cingulate is coupled functionally with multiple regions throughout the cerebrum. A factor analysis of the significant regional activations further emphasized this functional coupling. The cingulate or related mesial frontal cortices loaded on each of the seven factors identified in the factor analysis. Other regions that loaded significantly on on these factors have been described previously as belonging to anatomically connected circuits believed to subserve sensory tuning, receptive language, vigilance, working memory, response selection motor planning, and motor response functions. These seven factors appeared to be oriented topographically within the anterior cingulate, with sensory, working memory, and vigilance functions planning, and motor response positioned progressively more caudally.
   Conclusions: These findings support a parallel distributed processing model for word-color interference in which portions of the anterior cingulate cortex modify the strengths of multiple neural pathways used to read and name colors. Allocation of attentional resources is thought to modify pathway strengths by reducing cross-talk between information processing modules that subserve the competing demands of reading and color naming. The functional topography of these neural systems observed within the cingulate argues for the presence of multiple attentional subsystems, each contributing to improved task performance. The topography also suggests a role for the cingulate in coordinating and integrating the activity of these multiple attentional subsystems.

AB A working hypothesis is proposed for piriform cortex (PC) and other olfactory cortical areas that redefines the traditional functional roles as follows: the olfactory bulb serves as the primary olfactory cortex by virtue of encoding 'molecular features' (structural components common to many odorant molecules) as a patchy mosaic reminiscent of the representation of simple features in primary visual cortex. The anterior olfactory cortex (that has been inappropriately termed the anterior olfactory nucleus) detects and stores correlations between olfactory features, creating representations (gestalts) for particular odorants and odorant mixtures. This function places anterior olfactory cortex at the level of secondary visual cortex. PC carries out functions that have traditionally defined association cortex-it detects and learns correlations between olfactory gestalts formed in anterior olfactory cortex and a large repertoire of behavioral, cognitive and contextual information to which it has access through reciprocal connections with prefrontal, entorhinal, perirhinal and amygdaloid areas. Using principles derived from artificial networks with biologically plausible parallel-distributed architectures and Hebbian synaptic plasticity (i.e. adjustments in synaptic strength based on locally convergent activity), functional proposals are made for PC and related cortical areas. Architectural features incorporated include extensive recurrent connectivity in anterior PC, predominantly feedforward connectivity in posterior PC and backprojections that connect distal to proximal structures in the cascade of olfactory cortical areas. Capabilities of the 'reciprocal feedforward correlation' architecture that characterizes PC and adjoining higher-order areas are discussed in some detail. The working hypothesis is preceded by a review of relevant anatomy and physiology, and a non-quantitative account of parallel-distributed principles. To increase the accessibility of findings for PC and to advertise its substantial potential as a model for experimental and modeling analysis of associative processes, parallels are described between PC and the hippocampal formation, inferotemporal visual cortex and prefrontal cortex.

TI Interference and facilitation effects during selective attention: An
   (H2O)-O-15 PET study of Stroop task performance
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB To investigate the functional anatomy of interference and facilitation during selective attention, we studied 15 normal subjects using the (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography technique and a computer presented single-trial Stroop task for cognitive activation. Increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were observed in a network of structures that have been previously associated with selective attention, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, the frontal polar cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and the thalamus, as well as the lingual gyrus. Furthermore rCBF decreases (compared to control states) were observed in lateral extra-striate cortex. rCBF changes in prefrontal and extra-striate regions varied with differences in the need to modulate the influence of word and color information while subjects responded to either incongruent or congruent Stroop stimuli. These results indicate the utility of Stroop procedures for investigating the functional anatomy of selective attention, Given recent interest regarding the role of the anterior cingulate gyrus in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, our results also suggest that the Stroop task can serve as a reliable neurobehavioral probe for this region. The significance of these results for understanding processing mechanisms underlying selective attention is discussed within the framework of a parallel distributed processing model of Stroop task performance.

TI The molecular dynamics of pain control
SO NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE
AB Pain is necessary for survival, but persistent pain can result in anxiety, depression and a reduction in the quality of life. The discriminative and affective qualities of pain are both thought to be regulated in an activity-dependent fashion. Recent studies have identified cells and molecules that regulate pain sensitivity and the parallel pathways that distribute nociceptive information to limbic or sensory areas of the forebrain. Here, we emphasize the cellular and neurobiological consequences of pain, especially those that are involved in the generation and maintenance of chronic pain. These new insights into pain processing will significantly alter our approach to pain control and the development of new analgesics.

TI Event-related brain potential correlates of emotional face processing
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB Results from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies investigating brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of emotional facial expression are reviewed. In all experiments, emotional faces were found to trigger an increased ERP positivity relative to neutral faces. The onset of this emotional expression effect was remarkably early, ranging from 120 to 180 ms post-stimulus in different experiments where faces were either presented at fixation or laterally, and with or without non-face distractor stimuli. While broadly distributed positive deflections beyond 250 ms post-stimulus have been found in previous studies for non-face stimuli, the early frontocentrally distributed phase of this emotional positivity is most likely face-specific. Similar emotional expression effects were found for six basic emotions, suggesting that these effects are not primarily generated within neural structures specialised for the automatic detection of specific emotions. Expression effects were eliminated when attention was directed away from the location of peripherally presented emotional faces, indicating that they are not linked to pre-attentive emotional processing. When foveal faces were unattended, expression effects were attenuated, but not completely eliminated. It is suggested that these ERP correlates of emotional face processing reflect activity within a neocortical system where representations of emotional content are generated in a task-dependent fashion for the adaptive intentional control of behaviour. Given the early onset of the emotion-specific effects reviewed here, it is likely that this system is activated in parallel with the ongoing evaluation of emotional content in the amygdala and related subcortical brain circuits.

TI TIME AND THE OBSERVER - THE WHERE AND WHEN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BRAIN
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB We compare the way two models of consciousness treat subjective timing.  According to the standard "Cartesian Theater" model, there is a place in the brain where "it all comes together," and the discriminations in all modalities are somehow put into registration and "presented" for subjective judgment.  The timing of the events in this theater determines subjective order.  According to the alternative "Multiple Drafts" model, discriminations are distributed in both space and time in the brain.  These events do have temporal properties, but those properties do not determine subjective order because there is no single, definitive "stream of consciousness," only a parallel stream of conflicting and continuously revised contents.  Four puzzling phenomena that resist explanation by the Cartesian model are analyzed:  (1) a gradual apparent motion phenomenon involving abrupt color change (Kolers & von Grunau 1976), (2) an illusion of an evenly spaced series of "hops" produced by two or more widely spaced series of taps delivered to the skin (Geldard & Sherrick's "cutaneous rabbit" [1972], (3) backwards referral in time, and (4) subjective delay of consciousness of intention (both reported in this journal by Libet 1985a; 1987; 1989a).  The unexamined assumptions that have always made the Cartesian Theater so attractive are exposed and dismantled.  The Multiple Drafts model provides a better account of the puzzling phenomena, avoiding the scientific and metaphysical extravagances of the Cartesian Theater:  The temporal order of subjective events is a product of the brain's interpretational processes, not a direct reflection of events making up those processes.

TI FREQUENCY AND NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS ON LEXICAL ACCESS - LEXICAL
   SIMILARITY OR ORTHOGRAPHIC REDUNDANCY
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION
AB Five experiments investigated the effects of word frequency, neighborhood size, and bigram frequency on lexical decision and word-naming performance. Large neighborhood size, manipulated independently of bigram frequency, facilitated lexical decision and standard naming latencies for low-frequency words but had no effect on delayed naming performance. Bigram frequency, manipulated independently of neighborhood size, had no effect on lexical decision or naming performance. The data suggest that effects of neighborhood size reflect lexical similarity rather than orthographic redundancy and that they are due to lexical access rather than processes specific to lexical decision or naming tasks. The results are incompatible with models assuming that lexical access involves a serial comparison process. The implications for parallel models assuming localized and distributed representations are discussed.

TI LARGE-SCALE CORTICAL NETWORKS AND COGNITION
SO BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB The well-known parcellation of the mammalian cerebral cortex into a large number of functionally distinct cytoarchitectonic areas presents a problem for understanding the complex cortical integrative functions that underlie cognition. How do cortical areas having unique individual functional properties cooperate to accomplish these complex operations? Do neurons distributed throughout the cerebral cortex act together in large-scale functional assemblages? This review examines the substantial body of evidence supporting the view that complex integrative functions are carried out by large-scale networks of cortical areas. Pathway tracing studies in non-human primates have revealed widely distributed networks of interconnected cortical areas, providing an anatomical substrate for large-scale parallel processing of information in the cerebral cortex. Functional coactivation of multiple cortical areas has been demonstrated by neurophysiological studies in non-human primates and several different cognitive functions have been shown to depend on multiple distributed areas by human neuropsychological studies. Electrophysiological studies on interareal synchronization have provided evidence that active neurons in different cortical areas may become not only coactive, but also functionally interdependent. The computational advantages of synchronization between cortical areas in large-scale networks have been elucidated by studies using artificial neural network models. Recent observations of time-varying multi-areal cortical synchronization suggest that the functional topology of a large-scale cortical network is dynamically reorganized during visuomotor behavior.

TI Long-term plasticity of intrinsic excitability: Learning rules and
   mechanisms
SO LEARNING & MEMORY
AB Spatio-temporal configurations of distributed activity in the brain is thought to contribute to the coding of neuronal information and synaptic contacts between nerve cells could play a central role in the formation of privileged pathways of activity. Synaptic plasticity is not the exclusive mode of regulation of information processing in the brain, and persistent regulations of ionic conductances in some specialized neuronal areas such as the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon could also modulate, in the long-term, the propagation of neuronal information. Persistent changes in intrinsic excitability have been reported in several brain areas in which activity is elevated during a classical conditioning. The role of synaptic activity seems to be a determinant in the induction, but the learning rules and the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We discuss here the role of synaptic activity in the induction of intrinsic plasticity in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons. Activation of glutamate receptors initiates a long-term modification in neuronal excitability that may represent a parallel, synergistic substrate for learning and memory. Similar to synaptic plasticity, long-lasting intrinsic plasticity appears to be bidirectional and to express a certain level of input or cell specificity. These nonsynaptic forms of plasticity affect the signal propagation in the axon, the dendrites, and the soma. They not only share common learning rules and induction pathways with the better-known synaptic plasticity such as NMDA receptor dependent LTP and LTD, but also contribute in synergy with these synaptic changes to the formation of a coherent engram.

TI A spatiotemporal profile of visual system activation revealed by current
   source density analysis in the awake macaque
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB We investigated the spatiotemporal activation pattern, produced by one Visual stimulus, across cerebral cortical regions in awake monkeys. Laminar profiles of postsynaptic potentials and action potentials were indexed with current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity profiles respectively. Locally, we found contrasting activation profiles in dorsal and ventral stream areas. The former, like V1 and V2, exhibit a 'feedforward' profile, with excitation beginning at the depth of Lamina 4, followed by activation of the extragranular laminae. The latter often displayed a multilaminar/columnar profile, with initial responses distributed across the laminae and reflecting modulation rather than excitation; CSD components were accompanied by either no changes or by suppression of action potentials. System-wide, response latencies indicated a large dorsal/ventral stream latency advantage, which generalizes across a wide range of methods. This predicts a specific temporal ordering of dorsal and Ventral stream components of visual analysis, as well as specific patterns of dorsal-ventral stream interaction. Our findings support a hierarchical model of cortical organization that combines serial and parallel elements. Critical in such a model is the recognition that processing within a location typically entails multiple temporal components or 'waves' of activity, driven by input conveyed over heterogeneous pathways from the retina.

TI The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic cognition
SO NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE
AB How do we know what properties something has, and which of its properties should be generalized to other objects? How is the knowledge underlying these abilities acquired, and how is it affected by brain disorders? Our approach to these issues is based on the idea that cognitive processes arise from the interactions of neurons through synaptic connections. The knowledge in such interactive and distributed processing systems is stored in the strengths of the connections and is acquired gradually through experience. Degradation of semantic knowledge occurs through degradation of the patterns of neural activity that probe the knowledge stored in the connections. Simulation models based on these ideas capture semantic cognitive processes and their development and disintegration, encompassing domain-specific patterns of generalization in young children, and the restructuring of conceptual knowledge as a function of experience.

TI EXPERIENTIAL PHENOMENA OF TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY - FACTS AND HYPOTHESES
SO BRAIN
AB Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience.  These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology.  The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis.  Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a,b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based.  In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience.  Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content.  These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures.  Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge.

Ss named 96 low-frequency exception words categorized into 5 conditions on the basis of the position (1st through 5th) of their Ist irregular grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence (GPC). Latencies and error rates for these words were compared with the rates for 96 matched GPC regular controls. Results showed that the cost of irregularity decreased monotonically over the 5 positions of irregularity. This result is offered as evidence for dual-route models of reading and against parallel distributed processing models of reading.

TI Controlled & automatic processing: behavior, theory, and biological
   mechanisms
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB This paper provides an overview of developments in a dual processing theory of automatic and controlled processing that began with the empirical and theoretical work described by Schneider and Shiffrin (1977) and Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) over a quarter century ago. A review of relevant empirical findings suggests that there is a set of core behavioral phenomena reflecting differences between controlled and automatic processing that must be addressed by a successful theory. These phenomena relate to: consistency in training, serial versus parallel processing, level of effort, robustness to stressors, degree of control, effects on long-term memory, and priority encoding. We detail a computational model of controlled processing, CAP2, that accounts for these phenomena as emergent properties of an underlying hybrid computational architecture. The model employs a large network of distributed data modules that can categorize, buffer, associate, and prioritize information. Each module is a connectionist network with input and output layers, and each module communicates with a central Control System by outputting priority and activity report signals, and by receiving control signals. The Control System is composed of five processors including a Goal Processor, an Attention Controller, an Activity Monitor, an Episodic Store, and a Gating & Report Relay. The transition from controlled to automatic processing occurs in this model as the data modules become capable of transmitting their output without mediation by the Control System. We describe recent progress in mapping the components of this model onto specific neuroanatomical substrates, briefly discuss the potential for applying functional neuroimaging techniques to test the model's predictions, and its relation to other models.

This study replicates previous effects of frequency, predictability, and length of fixated words on fixation durations in natural reading and demonstrates new effects of these variables related to previous and next words. Results are based on fixation durations recorded from 222 persons, each reading 144 sentences. Such evidence for distributed processing of words across fixation durations challenges psycholinguistic immediacy-of-processing and eye-mind assumptions. Most of the time the mind processes several words in parallel at different perceptual and cognitive levels. Eye movements can help to unravel these processes.

TI Distribution of nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive nerves and
   identification of the cellular targets of nitric oxide in guinea-pig and
   human urinary bladder by cGMP immunohistochemistry
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB The distribution of nerves with the potential to synthesize nitric oxide was examined within the urinary bladder and proximal urethra of humans and guinea-pigs, using an antibody to nitric oxide synthase. Further experiments identified cells in which cGMP-immunoreactivity was induced following exposure to the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside. These cells represent the potential physiological targets of neuronally released nitric oxide, since activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, and a consequent rise in intracellular cGMP, mediate many of the effects of this transmitter. Nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactivity was widely distributed in the lower urinary tract. In guinea-pigs, 50-68% of all intrinsic vesical neurons expressed nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactivity, while in humans 72-96% of neurons in the wall of the bladder contained nitric oxide synthase. In both humans and guinea-pigs, varicose nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive nerve terminals provided a moderate innervation to the detrusor muscle of the bladder body, and a denser innervation to the urethral muscle. Immunoreactive nerves also projected to the subepithelium and around blood vessels, but were rarely observed encircling intramural vesical ganglia. Following stimulation with sodium nitroprusside, smooth muscle cells of the urethra expressed strong cGMP-immunoreactivity, but detrusor muscle cells remained uniformly negative. Although the detrusor muscle fibres did not express cGMP, numerous interstitial cells throughout the bladder body demonstrated an intense induction of cGMP-immunoreactivity by sodium nitroprusside. These cells had long dendritic processes extending parallel to the smooth muscle fibres, and contained vimentin, an intermediate filament expressed by cells of mesenchymal origin. Other cell types in which sodium nitroprusside exposure induced cGMP-immunoreactivity were the uroepithelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and a small number of varicose nerve terminals. In the guinea-pig, a minor proportion (less than 10%) of intrinsic neurons in the wall of the bladder also expressed cGMP. No intrinsic neurons were observed in specimens of human bladder processed for cGMP immunohistochemistry. The results provide anatomical evidence that nitric oxide may function as a neurotransmitter in the lower urinary tract. Although nerves with the capacity to produce nitric oxide supply both the detrusor muscle and the urethra, distinct regional differences exist in the effects of nitric oxide on the induction of cGMP. If the nitric oxide-mediated induction of cGMP is a reliable indicator of the physiological responsiveness of a cell to nitric oxide, then smooth muscle cells appear to be the predominant targets of nitric oxide in the urethra, while in the bladder body, interstitial cells may serve this role. These findings support previous studies which have implicated nitric oxide as an inhibitory transmitter involved in the relaxation of the bladder neck. Our experiments further indicate that a number of cell types within the lower urinary tract could potentially mediate the effects of endogenously released nitric oxide.

TI Task switching: A PDP model
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB When subjects switch between a pair of stimulus-response tasks, reaction time is slower on trial N if a different task was performed on trial N - 1. We present a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model that simulates this effect when subjects switch between word reading and color naming in response to Stroop stimuli. Reaction time on "switch trials" can be slowed by an extended response selection process which results from (a) persisting, inappropriate states of activation and inhibition of task-controlling representations and (b) associative learning, which allows stimuli to evoke tasks sets with which they have recently been associated (as proposed by Allport & Wylie, 2000). The model provides a good fit to a large body of empirical data, including findings which have been seen as problematic for this explanation of switch costs, and shows similar behavior when the parameters are set to random values, supporting Allport and Wylie's proposal.

TI DISTRIBUTED BUT CONVERGENT ORDERING OF CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS -
   ANALYSIS OF THE FRONTAL EYE FIELD AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD IN THE
   MACAQUE MONKEY
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB The degree of parallel processing in frontal cortex-basal ganglia circuits is a central and debated issue in research on the basal ganglia. To approach this issue directly, we analyzed and compared the corticostriatal projections of two principal oculomotor areas of the frontal lobes, the frontal eye field (FEF) and the supplementary eye field (SEF). We first identified cortical regions within or adjacent to each eye field by microstimulation in macaque monkeys and then injected each site with either S-35-methionine or WGA-HRP conjugate. We analyzed the corticostriatal projections and also the interconnections of the pairs of cortical areas.
   We observed major convergence of the projections of the FEF and the SEF within the striatum, principally in the caudate nucleus. In cross sections through the striatum, both projections were broken into a series of discontinuous input zones that seemed to be part of complex three-dimensional labyrinths. Where the FEF and SEF projection fields were both present, they overlapped patch for patch. Thus, both inputs were dispersed within the striatum but converged with one another. Striatal afferents from cortex adjacent to the FEF and the SEF did not show convergence with SEF and FEF inputs, but did, in part, converge with one another. For all pairs of cortical areas tested, the degree of overlap in the corticostriatal projections appeared to be directly correlated with the degree of cortical interconnectivity of the areas injected. All of the corticostriatal fiber projections observed primarily avoided immunohistochemically identified striosomes. We conclude that there is convergence of oculomotor information from two distinct regions of the frontal cortex to the striatal matrix, which is known to project into pallidonigral circuits including the striatonigrocollicular pathway of the saccadic eye movement system. Furthermore, functionally distinct premotor areas near the oculomotor fields often systematically projected to striatal zones adjacent to oculomotor field projections, suggesting an anatomical basis for potential interaction of these inputs within the striatum. We propose that parallel processing is not the exclusive principle of organization of forebrain circuits associated with the basal ganglia. Rather, patterns of both convergence and divergence are present and are likely to depend on multiple functional and developmental constraints.

TI Temporal binding, binocular rivalry, and consciousness
SO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB Cognitive functions like perception, memory, language, or consciousness are based on highly parallel and distributed information processing by the brain. One of the major unresolved questions is how information can be integrated and how coherent representational states can be established in the distributed neuronal systems subserving these functions. It has been suggested that this so-called ''binding problem'' may be solved in the temporal domain. The hypothesis is that synchronization of neuronal discharges can serve for the integration of distributed neurons into cell assemblies and that this process may underlie the selection of perceptually and behaviorally relevant information. As we intend to show here, this temporal binding hypothesis has implications for the search of the neural correlate of consciousness. We review experimental results, mainly obtained in the visual system, which support the notion of temporal binding. In particular, we discuss recent experiments on the neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry which suggest that appropriate synchronization among cortical neurons may be one of the necessary conditions for the buildup of perceptual states and awareness of sensory stimuli.

TI THALAMIC AFFERENTS OF THE RAT BARREL CORTEX - A LIGHT-MICROSCOPIC AND
   ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC STUDY USING PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS LEUKOAGGLUTININ AS
   AN ANTEROGRADE TRACER
SO SOMATOSENSORY AND MOTOR RESEARCH
AB Anterograde tracers, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), were used to study the thalamocortical afferents of the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF) in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) at both light- and electron-microscopic levels. The PMBSF, also known as the barrel cortex, can be subdivided into barrel and interbarrel areas on the basis of cytoarchitectonic characteristics. Restricted injections confined to either the ventroposterior medial (VPM) or the rostral part of the posterior (Pom) nucleus allowed us to study and compare their projection patterns to the barrel cortex. We found that the interbarrel area receives inputs exclusively from the Pom, whereas the barrel area receives inputs from both the Pom and VPM. The laminar distributions of these two projections are largely segregated. After an injection of PHA-L or HRP into the VPM, labeled bouton-like swellings are found in layer VI and in layers IV through I of the barrel area, with the highest concentration in layer IV. On the other hand, after an injection of PHA-L or HRP into the Pom, labeled bouton-like swellings are distributed from upper layer V to layer I of the interbarrel area, as well as in layers V and I of the barrel area. Ultrastructural analysis showed that labeled bouton-like swellings of the VPM and the Pom pathways make synaptic contacts onto cortical neurons, and that these contacts are asymmetrical. Therefore, the VPM and the Pom projections are complementary to each other in the barrel cortex, and together they provide thalamic inputs to most layers of both the barrel and interbarrel areas. The differential patterns of terminations of the VPM and the Pom projections in the barrel cortex suggest that they may be involved in different types of cortical processing. Furthermore, our present findings may provide the anatomical basis for two parallel thalamocortical pathways, which previous physiological studies have indicated are each concerned with particular submodalities of somatic information.

TI The LONI Pipeline Processing Environment
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The analysis of raw data in neuroimaging has become a computationally entrenched process with many intricate steps run on increasingly larger datasets. Many software packages exist that provide either complete analyses or specific steps in an analysis. These packages often possess diverse input and output requirements, utilize different file formats, run in particular environments, and have limited abilities with certain types of data. The combination of these packages to achieve more sensitive and accurate results has become a common tactic in brain mapping studies but requires much work to ensure valid interoperation between programs. The handling, organization, and storage of intermediate data can prove difficult as well. The LONI Pipeline Processing Environment is a simple, efficient, and distributed computing solution to these problems enabling software inclusion from different laboratories in different environments. It is used here to derive a T1-weighted MRI atlas of the human brain from 452 normal young adult subjects with fully automated processing. The LONI Pipeline Processing Environment's parallel processing efficiency using an integrated client/server dataflow model was 80.9% when running the atlas generation pipeline from a PC client (Acer TravelMate 340T) on 48 dedicated server processors (Silicon Graphics Inc. Origin 3000). The environment was 97.5% efficient when the same analysis was run on eight dedicated processors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

TI No right to speak? The relationship between object naming and semantic
   impairment: Neuropsychological abstract evidence and a computational
   model
SO JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB The processes required for object naming were addressed in a study of patients with semantic dementia (a selective decline of semantic memory resulting from progressive temporal lobe atrophy) and in a computational model of single-word production. Although all patients with semantic dementia are impaired in both single-word production and comprehension, previous reports had indicated two different patterns: (a) a parallel decline in accuracy of naming and comprehension with frequent semantic naming errors, suggesting a purely semantic basis for the anemia and (b) a dramatic progressive anemia without commensurate decline in comprehension, which might suggest a mainly postsemantic source of the anomia. Longitudinal data for 16 patients with semantic dementia reflected these two profiles, but with the following additional important specifications: (1) despite a few relatively extreme versions of one or other profile, the full set of cases formed a continuum in the extent of anomia for a given degree of degraded comprehension; (2) the degree of disparity between these two abilities was associated with relative asymmetry in laterality of atrophy: a parallel decline in the two measures characterized patients with greater right than left-temporal atrophy, while disproportionate anemia occurred with a predominance of atrophy in the left-temporal lobe. In an implemented computational model of naming, semantic representations were distributed across simulated left- and right-temporal regions, but the semantic units on the left were more strongly connected to left-lateralized phonological representations. Asymmetric damage to semantic units reproduced the longitudinal patient profiles of naming relative to comprehension. plus additional characteristics of che patients' naming performance. On the basis of both the neuropsychological and computational evidence, we propose that semantic impairment alone can account for the full range of word production deficits described here.

TI Serial pathways from primate prefrontal cortex to autonomic areas may
   influence emotional expression
SO BMC NEUROSCIENCE
AB Background: Experiencing emotions engages high-order orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal areas, and expressing emotions involves low-level autonomic structures and peripheral organs. How is information from the cortex transmitted to the periphery? We used two parallel approaches to map simultaneously multiple pathways to determine if hypothalamic autonomic centres are a key link for orbitofrontal areas and medial prefrontal areas, which have been associated with emotional processes, as well as low-level spinal and brainstem autonomic structures. The latter innervate peripheral autonomic organs, whose activity is markedly increased during emotional arousal.
   Results: We first determined if pathways linking the orbitofrontal cortex with the hypothalamus overlapped with projection neurons directed to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, with the aid of neural tracers injected in these disparate structures. We found that axons from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices converged in the hypothalamus with neurons projecting to brainstem and spinal autonomic centers, linking the highest with the lowest levels of the neuraxis. Using a parallel approach, we injected bidirectional tracers in the lateral hypothalamic area, an autonomic center, to label simultaneously cortical pathways leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axons projecting to low-level brainstem and spinal autonomic centers. We found densely distributed projection neurons in medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axonal terminations in several brainstem structures and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, which innervate peripheral autonomic organs. We then provided direct evidence that axons from medial prefrontal cortex synapse with hypothalamic neurons, terminating as large boutons, comparable in size to the highly efficient thalamocortical system. The interlinked orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal areas and hypothalamic autonomic centers were also connected with the amygdala.
   Conclusions: Descending pathways from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, which are also linked with the amygdala, provide the means for speedy influence of the prefrontal cortex on the autonomic system, in processes underlying appreciation and expression of emotions.

TI Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience
   and medicine
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB A broad range of evidence regarding the functional organization of the vertebrate brain - spanning from comparative neurology to experimental psychology and neurophysiology to clinical data - is reviewed for its bearing on conceptions of the neural organization of consciousness. A novel principle relating target selection, action selection, and motivation to one another, as a means to optimize integration for action in real time, is introduced. With its help, the principal macrosystems of the vertebrate brain can be seen to form a centralized functional design in which an upper brain stem system organized for conscious function performs a penultimate step in action control. This upper brain stem system retained a key role throughout the evolutionary process by which an expanding forebrain - culminating in the cerebral cortex of mammals - came to serve as a medium for the elaboration of conscious contents. This highly conserved upper brainstem system, which extends from the roof of the midbrain to the basal diencephalon, integrates the massively parallel and distributed information capacity of the cerebral hemispheres into the limited-capacity, sequential mode of operation required for coherent behavior. It maintains special connective relations with cortical territories implicated in attentional and conscious functions, but is not rendered nonfunctional in the absence of cortical input. This helps explain the purposive, goal-directed behavior exhibited by mammals after experimental decortication, as well as the evidence that children born without a cortex are conscious. Taken together these circumstances suggest that brainstem mechanisms are integral to the constitution of the conscious state, and that an adequate account of neural mechanisms of conscious function cannot be confined to the thalamocortical complex alone.

TI Attention to emotion modulates fMRI activity in human right superior
   temporal sulcus
SO COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH
AB A parallel neural network has been proposed for processing various types of information conveyed by faces including emotion. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested the effect of the explicit attention to the emotional expression of the faces on the neuronal activity of the face-responsive regions. Delayed match to sample procedure was adopted. Subjects were required to match the visually presented pictures with regard to the contour of the face pictures, facial identity, and emotional expressions by valence (happy and fearful expressions) and arousal (fearful and sad expressions). Contour matching of the non-face scrambled pictures was used as a control condition. The face-responsive regions that responded more to faces than to non-face stimuli were the bilateral lateral fusiform gyrus; (LFG), the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS). In these regions, general attention to the face enhanced the activities of the bilateral LFG, the right STS, and the left IPS compared with attention to the contour of the facial image. Selective attention to facial emotion specifically enhanced the activity of the right STS compared with attention to the face per se. The results suggest that the right STS region plays a special role in facial emotion recognition within distributed face-processing systems. This finding may support the notion that the STS is involved in social perception. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Does the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus play a role in language?
   A brain stimulation study
SO BRAIN
AB Although advances in diffusion tensor imaging have enabled us to better study the anatomy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), its function remains poorly understood. Recently, it was suggested that the subcortical network subserving the language semantics could be constituted, in parallel with the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, by the left ILF, joining the posterior occipitotemporal regions to the temporal pole, then relayed by the uncinate fasciculus connecting the anterior temporal pole to the frontobasal areas. Nevertheless, this hypothesis was solely based on neurofunctional imaging, allowing a cortical mapping but with no anatomofunctional information regarding the white matter. Here, we report a series of 12 patients operated on under local anaesthesia for a cerebral low-grade glioma located within the left temporal lobe. Before and during resection, we used the method of intraoperative direct electrostimulation, enabling us to perform accurate and reliable anatomofunctional correlations both at cortical and subcortical levels. In order to map the ILF. Using postoperative MRI, we correlated these functional findings with the anatomical locations of the sites where language disturbances were elicited by stimulations, both at cortical and subcortical levels. Our goal was to study the potential existence of parallel and distributed language networks crossing the left dominant temporal lobe, sub-served by distinct subcortical pathways namely the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the ILF. Intraoperative stimulation of the anterior and middle temporal cortex elicited anomia in four patients. At the subcortical level, semantic paraphasia were induced in seven patients during stimulation of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and phonological paraphasia was generated in seven patients by stimulating the arcuate fasciculus. Interestingly, subcortical stimulation never elicited any language disturbances when performed at the level of the ILF. In addition, following a transient postoperative language deficit, all patients recovered, despite the resection of at least one part of the ILF, as confirmed by control MRI. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the "semantic ventral stream" could be constituted by at least two parallel pathways within the left dominant temporal lobe: (i) a direct pathway, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, that connects the posterior temporal areas and the orbitofrontal region, crucial for language semantic processing, since it elicits semantic paraphasia when stimulated; (ii) and also possibly an indirect pathway subserved by the ILF, not indispensable for language, since it can be compensated both during stimulation and after resection.

TI PREMOTOR CORTEX OF MONKEYS - SET-RELATED AND MOVEMENT-RELATED ACTIVITY
   REFLECTING AMPLITUDE AND DIRECTION OF WRIST MOVEMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB 1. Neuronal activity was recorded from the premotor cortex (PM) of Japanese monkeys while they performed hand movements with different amplitudes and directions. On each behavioral trial, two instructions were given sequentially: 1) an amplitude instruction (large or small) and 2) a direction instruction (flexion or extension). The onset of movement was triggered by a visual signal after a delay period.
   2. Among various kinds of task-related neuronal activity recorded in the PM, two types were selected for study: 1) set-related activity, sustained activity change during the delay period that followed presentation of instruction signals (IS); and 2) movement-related activity, activity change immediately before and during a movement, which followed the trigger signal (TS) presentation.
   3. Thirty-two of 101 set-related neurons showed activity change after presentation of the first IS (Delay 1 set-related activity), when they were instructed in either amplitude or direction, but not both. All of the set-related neurons showed activity modulation after presentation of the second IS (Delay 2 set-related activity). When neurons showed both Delay 1 and Delay 2 set-related activity, they were usually more active during Delay 2, i.e., when the monkeys had received both amplitude and directional ISs. A majority of neurons with Delay 2 set-related activity (64%) showed relation to both movement amplitude and direction. Twenty-eight percent of the neurons showed relation to either amplitude or direction, but not both. These findings seem consistent with a view that serial, rather than parallel, processes of motor programming operate in preparation of intended movements.
   4. A majority of PM neurons with movement-related activity (51%) showed activity change related to both the direction and amplitude of movement. Forty-two percent showed selective relation to either direction or amplitude. These findings support a view that PM contributes to the control of limb movements.
   5. Histological reconstruction showed that a vast majority of PM set-related neurons were located in the dorsal aspect of the PM (PMd), medial to the arcuate spur and lateral to the superior precentral sulcus. In contrast, movement-related neurons were distributed in two distinct foci: one in the ventral aspect of the PM (PMv), immediately caudal to the genu of the arcuate sulcus and lateral to the spur of the sulcus; and the other in the PMd, overlapping the location of set-related neurons. The data support the hypothesis that PMd and PMv play different roles in motor control. PMd may contribute more to motor preparation by supporting neural programs necessary for an intended action, whereas PMv may be more specialized for execution of a visually guided movement. The set- and movement-related activity in the PMd and PMv may be transmitted to the primary motor cortex (MI) to generate motor commands to lower motor centers.

AB Odorant signal processing takes place in a diverse group of primary olfactory areas which receive direct input from the olfactory bulb. Orbitofrontal cortices participate in olfactory functions, but the pathways through which they receive olfactory or other input have not been clearly defined. The retrograde tracers horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes were injected in orbital cortices to study their afferent cortical connections. Labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas (prepiriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle) were directed mainly to a posterior orbitofrontal region and to a lesser extent the neighboring caudal part of area 13. There was no evidence of direct projections from primary olfactory areas to the rostral parts of area 13, or to areas 12 or 11. Most labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas were directed to agranular cortices, fewer projected to dysgranular areas, and there was no evidence that any reached granular cortices. The areas which received the most robust olfactory projections showed the lowest degree of laminar organization among prefrontal cortices. Early processing in the olfactory system thus takes place in areas which differ sharply on structural grounds from ''early'' eulaminate post-Rolandic sensory cortices.
   In addition to olfactory cortical projections, numerous labeled neurons in transitional (limbic) cortices were directed to orbital areas, and fewer but still substantial numbers of afferent neurons were found in eulaminate cortices. Unlike post-Rolandic unimodal sensory areas, which seem to be committed to the processing of input from one sensory modality via sequential and/or parallel pathways, caudal orbital areas received highly distributed input from primary olfactory areas, and in addition, from gustatory, visual, auditory and somatosensory areas.
   The structural and connectional features of olfactory recipient orbital cortices thus differ markedly from those observed in other sensory association areas and suggest a mode of processing adapted early in cortical evolution.

TI VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION - EVIDENCE FOR STRATEGIC CONTROL OF LEXICAL AND
   NONLEXICAL ROUTINES IN ORAL READING
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION
AB The spelling-sound correspondences in written Persian are always consistent, but some of the words include vowels as a fixed part of their spelling (phonologically transparent words), whereas for other words the vowels are typically not specified (phonologically opaque words). Two speeded naming studies show that semantic relatedness and word frequency affect performance (a) on both classes of words when the context excludes nonwords, and (b) affects opaque words but not transparent words when nonwords form part of the context. A further study shows that (a) transparent words yield word frequency effects when nonwords are absent from the context, and (b) the frequency effect disappears when nonwords form part of the context. The data favor a flexible multiple route model of word recognition whose operation is inconsistent with both the orthographic depth hypothesis and the definitional facts of parallel distributed processing.

AB Understanding the conditions under which the brain integrates the different sensory streams and the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon is now a question at the forefront of neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities for investigating these multisensory processes using modern imaging techniques, the nature of the information obtainable from each method and their benefits and limitations. Despite considerable variability in terms of paradigm design and analysis, some consistent findings are beginning to emerge. The detection of brain activity in human neuroimaging studies that resembles multisensory integration responses at the cellular level in other species, suggests similar crossmodal binding mechanisms may be operational in the human brain. These mechanisms appear to be distributed across distinct neuronal networks that vary depending on the nature of the shared information between different sensory cues. For example, differing extents of correspondence in time, space or content seem to reliably bias the involvement of different integrative networks which code for these cues. A combination of data obtained from haemodynamic and electromagnetic methods, which offer high spatial or temporal resolution respectively, are providing converging evidence of multisensory interactions at both "early" and "late" stages of processing-suggesting a cascade of synergistic processes operating in parallel at different levels of the cortex.

TI A PARALLEL DISTRIBUTED-PROCESSING APPROACH TO AUTOMATICITY
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB We consider how a particular set of information processing principles, developed within the parallel distributed processing (PDP) framework, can address issues concerning automaticity. These principles include graded, activation-based processing that is subject to attentional modulation; incremental, connection-based learning; and interactivity and competition in processing. We show how simulation models, based on these principles, can account for the major phenomena associated with automaticity, as well as many of those that have been troublesome for more traditional theories. In particular, we show how the PDP framework provides an alternative to the usual dichotomy between automatic and controlled processing and can explain the relative nature of automaticity as well as the fact that seemingly automatic processes can be influenced by attention. We also discuss how this framework can provide insight into the role that bidirectional influences play in processing: that is, how attention can influence processing at the same time that processing influences attention. Simulation models of the Stroop color-word task and the Eriksen response-competition task are described that help illustrate the application of the principles to performance in specific behavioral tasks.

TI AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL (ERP) ANALYSIS OF SEMANTIC CONGRUITY AND
   REPETITION EFFECTS IN SENTENCES
SO JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB In two experiments, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and cued-recall performance measures were used to examine die consequences of semantic congruity and repetition on the processing of words in sentences. A set of sentences, half of which ended with words that rendered them semantically incongruous, was repeated either once (e.g., Experiment 1) or twice (e.g., Experiment 2). After each block of sentences, subjects were given all of the sentences and asked to recall the missing final words.
   Repetition benefited the recall of both congruous and incongruous endings and reduced the amplitude and shortened the duration of the N400 component of the ERP more for (1) incongruous than congruous words, (2) open class than closed class words, and (3) low-frequency than high-frequency open class words. For incongruous sentence terminations, repetition increased the amplitude of a broad positive component subsequent to the N400.
   Assuming additive factors logic and a traditional view of the lexicon, our N400 results indicate that in addition to their singular effects, semantic congruity, repetition, and word frequency converge to influence a common stage of lexical processing. Within a parallel distributed processing framework, our results argue for substantial temporal and spatial overlap in the activation of codes subserving word recognition so as to yield the observed interactions of repetition with semantic congruity, lexical class, and word frequency effects.

TI Rules vs. analogy in English past tenses: a computational/experimental
   study
SO COGNITION
AB Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., & Prince, A. (1998). On language and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73-193) posits that speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new "wug test" data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE
AB From the earliest ages at which infants search for hidden objects, they make the A (B) over bar error, searching perseveratively at previous rather than current hiding locations (Piaget, 1954). This paper presents a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model that instantiates an explicit set of processing mechanisms to account for a large and diverse set of data on infants' A (B) over bar errors. The model demonstrates how basic processes U the formation of latent memory traces and their interaction with developing active memory traces U can provide a unifying framework for understanding why and when infants perseverate. Novel predictions from the model are discussed, together with its challenges for theories that posit a concept of object permanence in the first year of life.

TI Attention, short-term memory, and action selection: A unifying theory
SO PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent processing of information that emerges from the links between attentional perceptual processes, working memory and reward-based evaluation of the performed actions. We describe a computational neuroscience theoretical framework which shows how an attentional state held in a short term memory in the prefrontal cortex can by top-down processing influence ventral and dorsal stream cortical areas using biased competition to account for many aspects of visual attention. We also show how within the prefrontal cortex an attentional bias can influence the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs, and thus play an important role in decision making. We also show how the absence of expected rewards can switch an attentional bias signal, and thus rapidly and flexibly alter cognitive performance. This theoretical framework incorporates spiking and synaptic dynamics which enable single neuron responses, fMRI activations, psychophysical results, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the effects of damage to parts of the system to be explicitly simulated and predicted. This computational neuroscience framework provides an approach for integrating different levels of investigation of brain function, and for understanding the relations between them. The models also directly address how bottom-up and top-down processes interact in visual cognition, and show how some apparently serial processes reflect the operation of interacting parallel distributed systems.

SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB Most cognitive functions are based on highly parallel and distributed information processing by the brain. A paradigmatic example is provided by the vertebrate visual system where numerous cortical areas have been described which analyse different types of visual information. At present, it is unclear how information can he integrated and how coherent representational states can be established in such distributed systems. We suggest that this so-called 'binding problem' may be solved in the temporal domain. The hypothesis is that synchronization of neuronal discharges can serve far the integration of distributed neurons into cell assemblies and that this process may underlie the selection of perceptually and behaviourally relevant information. We review experimental results, mainly obtained in the visual system, which support this temporal binding hypothesis.

TI ENHANCED NMDA CONDUCTANCE CAN ACCOUNT FOR EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY-INDUCED
   BY LOW MG2+ IN THE RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB 1. Why does lowering extracellular Mg2+ cause synchronous neuronal bursts and after-discharges? To address this question, a computer model of the CA3 region was constructed with 1000 pyramidal neurones and 100 inhibitory neurones. Pyramidal neurones were multicompartmental and contained five ionic conductances, distributed non-uniformly on the membrane. In parallel, experiments were performed on rat hippocampal slices perfused in solutions without added Mg2+
   2. Model neurones were interconnected randomly as follows. Recurrent excitatory connections between pyramidal neurones, and from pyramidal neurones to inhibitory cells, stimulated both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (rapid, voltage and Mg2+ independent) and NMDA receptors (slow conductance decay, voltage and Mg2+ dependent). A time-dependent 'desensitization' process was included whereby the NMDA-mediated conductance declined after the onset of synchronized firing. Half of the inhibitory neurones activated GABA(A) receptors on pyramidal cells (perisomatic, rapid), and half activated GABA(B) receptors (dendritic, slow onset and decay).
   3. We examined patterns of synchronous firing in the pyramidal cells as parameters defining model features were manipulated. These parameters included the maximum conductance of individual synapses, [Mg2(o)(+]), excitatory connectivity, and parameters that defined the NMDA 'desensitization' process. Comparisons were made with experiment where possible.
   4. GABA(A) blockade in 1 mM [Mg2+](o) induces single bursts and bursts with after-discharges. Synchronized bursts and after-discharges also occurred in the model when NMDA conductances were sufficiently enhanced, even with GABA(A) inhibition present. Both in simulated and experimental after-discharges in low-Mg2+ solutions, the level of GABA(A) inhibition was important in determining the number of secondary bursts and the number of somatic spikes per wave.
   5. The model of low-Mg2+-induced synchrony predicts that each somatic wave is induced by a dendritic Ca2+ spike and that the dendritic spikes are superimposed on a tonic dendritic depolarization generated by the enhanced NMDA conductance. We further predict the recurrent activation of interneurones by NMDA receptors, based both on experiments and simulations in which AMPA receptors are blocked.
   6. Many of the mechanisms underlying low-Mg2+-induced after-discharges appear to resemble those underlying picrotoxin-induced after-discharges. These mechanisms can operate in low-Mg2+ solutions because of the increase in NMDA conductance in the recurrent excitatory connections.

TI Fly Motion Vision
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEUROSCIENCE, VOL 33
SE Annual Review of Neuroscience
AB Fly motion vision and resultant compensatory optomotor responses are a classic example for neural computation. Here we review our current understanding of processing of optic flow as generated by an animal's self-motion. Optic flow processing is accomplished in a series of steps: First, the time-varying photoreceptor signals are fed into a two-dimensional array of Reichardt-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). EMDs compute, in parallel, local motion vectors at each sampling point in space. Second, the output signals of many EMDs are spatially integrated on the dendrites of large-field tangential cells in the lobula plate. In the third step, tangential cells form extensive interactions with each other, giving rise to their large and complex receptive fields. Thus, tangential cells can act as matched filters tuned to optic flow during particular flight maneuvers. They finally distribute their information onto postsynaptic descending neurons, which either instruct the motor centers of the thoracic ganglion for flight and locomotion control or act themselves as motor neurons that control neck muscles for head movements.

CL HANSE INST ADV STUDY, DELMENHORST, GERMANY
HO HANSE INST ADV STUDY
AB In arbitrary visuomotor mapping, an object instructs a particular action or target of action, but does so in a particular way. In other forms of visuomotor control, the object is either the target of action (termed standard mapping) or its location provides the information needed for targeting (termed transformational mapping). By contrast, in arbitrary mapping, the object's location bears no systematic spatial relationship with the action. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigation has, in large part, identified the neural network that underlies the rapid acquisition and performance of arbitrary visuomotor mappings. This network consists of parts of the premotor (PM) and prefrontal (PF) cortex, the hippocampal system (HS), and the basal ganglia (BG). Here, we propose specialized contributions of the network's different components to its overall function. To do so, we invoke the concept of distributed information-processing architectures, or modules, which may involve a variety of neural structures. According to this view, recurrent neural networks involving cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus operate largely in parallel. Each of these interacting networks can be termed a cortical-BG module. A large number of these modules include PM neurons, and they can be termed PM cortical-BG modules. A comparable number include PF neurons. termed PF cortical-BG modules. We propose that PM and PF cortical-BG modules compute specific object-to-action mappings, in which the network learns the action associated with a given input. These mappings serve as specific solutions to arbitrary visuomotor mapping problems. However, they are also exemplars of more abstract rules, such as the knowledge that nonspatial visual information (e.g., color) can guide the choice of action. We propose that PF cortical-BG modules subserve abstract rules of this kind, along with other problem-solving strategies. This view should not be taken to imply that the PF network lacks the capacity to compute specific mappings, but rather that it has higher-order mapping functions in addition to its lower-order ones. Furthermore, it seems likely that PF provides PM with pertinent sensory information. The hippocampal system appears to play a role parallel to that of both neocortical-BG networks discussed here. However, in accord with several models, it operates mainly in the intermediate term, pending the consolidation of the relevant information in those neocortical-BG networks.

AB Theories of language production propose that utterances are constructed by a mechanism that separates linguistic content from linguistic structure. Linguistic content is retrieved from the mental lexicon, and is then inserted into slots in linguistic structures or frames. Support for this kind of model at the phonological level comes from patterns of phonological speech errors. W present an alternative account of these patterns using a connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) model that learns to produce sequences of phonological features. The model's errors exhibit some of the properties of human speech errors, specifically, properties that have been attributed to the action of phonological rules, frames, or other structural generalizations.

TI Corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones from the
   presupplementary motor area in the macaque monkey: comparison with the
   input zones from the supplementary motor area
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB The presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) is a cortical motor-related area which lies in the medial wall of the frontal lobe, immediately anterior to the supplementary motor area (SMA). This area has been considered to participate in the control of complex forelimb movements in a way different from the SMA. In an attempt to analyze the patterns of projections from the pre-SMA to the basal ganglia, we examined the distributions of pre-SMA inputs in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus and compared them with the SMA input distributions. To detect morphologically the terminal fields from the pre-SMA and the forelimb region of the SMA, anterograde tracers were injected into such areas that had been identified electrophysiologically in the macaque monkey. Corticostriatal inputs from the pre-SMA were distributed mainly in the striatal cell bridges connecting the rostral aspects of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, as well as in their neighboring striatal portions. These input zones were located, with no substantial overlap, rostral to corticostriatal input zones from the SMA forelimb region. Corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA were almost localized in the medial aspect of the nucleus, where corticosubthalamic inputs from the SMA forelimb region were also distributed predominantly. However, the major terminal fields from the pre-SMA were centered ventrally to those from the SMA. The present results indicate that the corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA appear to be segregated from the SMA-derived input zones. This implies the possibility of parallel processing of motor information from the pre-SMA and SMA in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI PROGRESSIVE DECLINE IN SPATIAL-LEARNING AND INTEGRITY OF FOREBRAIN
   CHOLINERGIC NEURONS IN RATS DURING AGING
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB Rats distributed over five different age groups, 3, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months of age, were screened for their spatial learning and memory ability in the Morris water maze, and the degree of place navigational impairments was correlated with morphological changes in the four major forebrain cholinergic cell groups (medial septum, MS; vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, VDB; nucleus basalis magnocellularis, NBM; and striatum) using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFr) histochemistry. Impaired place navigation developed progressively with age, such that 8% of the 12-month-old rats, 45% of the 18-month-old, 53% of the 24-month-old, and over 90% of the 30-month-old rats were behaviorally impaired. Significant reductions in the number of ChAT/NGFr-positive cell bodies, amounting to between 19 and 45%, were observed in all four cell groups, and the remaining cells were reduced in size (6-24% reduction in cross-sectional area in the oldest age groups). Although the morphological changes were less severe and tended to develop later than the behavioral impairments, there was overall a significant correlation between water maze performance and ChAT/NGFr-positive cell counts, and to a lesser degree also cell size in all four cell groups. These changes were also highly correlated with age. The highest correlations were seen in MS, VDB and NBM, which are known to play a role in spatial memory performance in young rats. The results indicate that degenerative and/or atrophic changes in the forebrain cholinergic system and decline in spatial learning ability are parallel processes during aging. Although the magnitude of the morphological changes does not appear to be substantial enough, by itself, to explain the severe spatial learning impairments that develop in the oldest animals, the present data are consistent with the view that impaired function in the forebrain cholinergic system can contribute to age-dependent cognitive decline in rodents.

TI How the deployment of attention determines what we see
SO VISUAL COGNITION
CT Munich Visual Search Symposium
CY JUN 06-10, 2003
CL Holzhausen, GERMANY
AB Attention is a tool to adapt what we see to our current needs. It can be focused narrowly on a single object or spread over several or distributed over the scene as a whole. In addition to increasing or decreasing the number of attended objects, these different deployments may have different effects on what we see. This article describes some research both on focused attention and its use in binding features, and on distributed attention and the kinds of information we gain and lose with the attention window opened wide. One kind of processing that we Suggest occurs automatically with distributed attention results in a statistical description of sets of similar objects. Another gives the gist of the scene, which may be inferred from sets of features registered in parallel. Flexible use of these different modes of attention allows us to reconcile sharp capacity limits with a richer understanding of the visual scene.

TI Some neurophysiological constraints on models of word naming
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The pronunciation of irregular words in deep orthographies like English cannot be specified by simple rules. On the other hand, the fact that novel letter strings can be pronounced seems to imply the existence of such rules. These facts motivate dual-route models of word naming, which postulate separate lexical (whole-word) and non-lexical (rule-based) mechanisms for accessing phonology. We used fMRI during oral naming of irregular words, regular words, and nonwords, to test this theory against a competing single-mechanism account known as the triangle model, which proposes that all words are handled by a single system containing distributed orthographic, phonological, and semantic codes rather than word codes. Two versions of the dual-route model were distinguished: an 'exclusive' version in which activation of one processing route predominates over the other, and a 'parallel' version in which both routes are equally activated by all words. The fMRI results provide no support for the exclusive dual-route model. Several frontal, insular, anterior cingulate, and parietal regions showed responses that increased with naming difficulty (nonword > irregular word > regular word) and were correlated with response time, but there was no activation consistent with the predicted response of a nonlexical, rule-based mechanism (i.e., nonword > regular word > irregular word). Several regions, including the angular gyros and dorsal prefrontal cortex bilaterally, left ventromedial temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate gyros, were activated more by words than nonwords, but these 'lexical route' regions were equally active for irregular and regular words. The results are compatible with both the parallel dual-route model and the triangle model. 'Lexical route' regions also showed effects of word imageability. Together with previous imaging studies using semantic task contrasts, the imageability effects are consistent with semantic processing in these brain regions, suggesting that word naming is partly semantically-mediated.

TI INTRINSIC CORTICAL CONNECTIONS IN MACAQUE VISUAL AREA V2 - EVIDENCE FOR
   INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL STREAMS
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB Area V2 of macaque visual cortex represents an important but poorly understood stage in visual processing. To provide a better understanding of the region, we studied the organization of its intrinsic cortical connections by making focal (200-300 mu m) iontophoretic microinjections of the tracer biocytin. Alternate tissue sections were tested for biocytin, cytochrome oxidase (CO), or Cat-301 immunoreactivity to localize biocytin label relative to the three stripelike compartments that characterize this area. Biocytin-labeled pyramidal neurons of layers 2/3, and, to a lesser extent, layer 5, provided laterally spreading axon projections that terminated in discrete patches (250-300 mu m diameter), primarily in layers 1-3. Any injected locus in V2 projected to 10-15 similarly sized patches, up to 4 mm from the injection site, and distributed in an elongated field orthogonal to the stripe compartments. We noted prominent patchy connections within, as well as between, individual compartments, perhaps reflecting functional substructures within stripes. Each stripe compartment projected to all three compartments but with different relative frequencies; CO-rich compartments projected mainly to other CO-rich compartments (75%), whereas CO-poor compartments projected equally to CO-rich and CO-poor compartments. We therefore emphasize the existence of substantial interconnections among all three V2 compartments. As further evidence for crosstalk between visual channels, we also noted an input to the V2 ''thick'' CO stripes from V1 cells in layer 4A as a distinct population in addition to the neurons of layer 4B. Thus, the CO stripe architecture may not be a marker for strictly segregated parallel visual pathways through V2. (C) 1994 Wileg-Liss, Inc.

TI The 'when' and 'where' of perceiving signals of threat versus non-threat
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We tested the proposal that signals of potential threat are given precedence over positive and neutral signals, reflected in earlier and more pronounced changes in neural activity. The temporal sequence ('when') and source localization ('where') of event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by fearful and happy facial expressions, compared to neutral control expressions, were examined for 219 healthy subjects. We scored ERPs over occipito-temporal sites (N80, 50-120 ms; P120 80-180 ms; N170, 120-220 ms; P230, 180-290 ms; N250, 230-35 ms) and their polarity-reversed counterparts over medial sites (P80, 40-120 ms; N120, 80-150 ms; VPP, 120-220 ms; N200,150-280 ms; P300, 280-450 ms). In addition to scoring peak amplitude and latency, the anatomical sources of activity were determined using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Fearful faces were distinguished by persistent increases in positivity, associated with a dynamical shift from temporo-frontal (first 120 ms) to more distributed cortical sources (120-220 ms) and back (220-450 ms). By contrast, expressions of happiness produced a discrete enhancement of negativity, later in the time course (230-350 ms) and localized to the fusiform region of the temporal cortex. In common, fear and happiness modulated the face-related N170, and produced generally greater right hemisphere activity. These findings support the proposal that fear signals are given precedence in the neural processing systems, such that processing of positive signals may be suppressed until vigilance for potential danger is completed. While fear may be processed via parallel pathways (one initiated prior to structural encoding), neural systems supporting positively valenced input may be more localized and rely on structural encoding.

TI Attentional functions of parietal and frontal cortex
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB A model of normal attentional function, based on the concept of competitive parallel processing, is used to compare attentional deficits following parietal and frontal lobe lesions. Measurements are obtained for visual processing speed, capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM), spatial bias (bias to left or right hemifield) and top-down control (selective attention based on task relevance). The results show important differences, but also surprising similarities, in parietal and frontal lobe patients. For processing speed and VSTM, deficits are selectively associated with parietal lesions, in particular lesions of the temporoparietal junction. We discuss explanations based on either grey matter or white matter lesions. In striking contrast, measures of attentional weighting (spatial bias and top-down control) are predicted by simple lesion volume. We suggest that attentional weights reflect competition between broadly distributed object representations. Parietal and frontal mechanisms work together, both in weighting by location and weighting by task context.

TI New approaches for exploring anatomical and functional connectivity in

SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Information processing in the primate brain is based on the complementary principles of modular and distributed information processing. The former emphasizes the specialization of functions within different brain areas. The latter emphasizes the massively parallel nature of brain networks and the fact that,function also emerges from the flow of information between brain areas. The localization of function to specific brain areas ("functional segregation") is The commonest approach to investigating function, however, an emerging, complementary approach ("functional integration") describes function in terms of the information flow across networks of areas. Here, we highlight recent advances in neuroimaging methodology that have made it possible to investigate the anatomical architecture of networks in the living human brain with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We also highlight recent thinking on the ways in which functional imaging can be used to characterize information transmission across networks in the human brain (functional and effective connectivity).

TI FUNCTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY OF CAT PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX - RESPONSES TO
   FREQUENCY-MODULATED SWEEPS
SO EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB The spatial distribution of neuronal responses to frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps was mapped with microelectrodes in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats. Increasing and decreasing FM sweeps (upward- and downward-directed FM sweeps, respectively) covering a range of 0.25 64.0 kHz were presented at three different rates of frequency change over time (i.e., sweep speed). Using multiunit recordings, the high-frequency domain (between 3.2 and 26.3 kHz) of Al was mapped over most of its dorsoventral extent (as determined by the distribution of the excitatory bandwidth, Q10dB) for all six cases studied. The spatial distributions of the preferred sweep speed and the preferred sweep direction were determined for each case. Neuronal responses for frequency sweeps of different speeds appeared to be systematically distributed along the dorsoventral axis of Al. In the dorsal region, cortical cells typically responded best to fast and/or medium FM sweeps, followed more ventrally by cells that responded best to medium - then slow -, then medium-speed FM sweeps. In the more ventral aspect of Al (which in some cases may also have included cells located in the dorsal region of the second auditory field, All), neurons generally preferred fast FM sweeps. However, a comparison of maps from different animals showed that there was more variability in the distribution of preferred speed responses in the ventral region of the cortex. The directional preference of units for FM sweeps was determined for the sweep speed producing the strongest response. Direction selectivity appeared to be nonrandomly distributed along the dorsoventral axis of AI. In general, units that responded best to upward-directed FM sweeps were located in the more dorsal and ventral aspects of Al while units that responded best to downward-directed FM sweeps were usually located in the mid-region of Al. Direction selectivity was also determined for multiunit responses at each of the three FM sweep speeds. In general, there was a relatively close agreement between the spatial distributions of direction selectivity determined for the strongest response with those calculated for the fast and medium speeds. The spatial distribution of direction selectivity determined for slow FM sweeps deviated somewhat from that determined for the strongest response. Near the dorsoventral center of the mapped areas, the distribution of units that responded best to downward sweeps tended to overlay the distribution of units that responded best to slow speeds, suggesting some spatial covariance of the two parameters. However, when the analysis was extended over the entire region of cortex examined in this study, the point-by-point correlation between preferred speed and direction selectivity was not statistically significant. In addition, when neural responses obtained from the dorsal and ventral subregions were analyzed separately, no significant correlation was observed between these two response parameters. This suggests that, for a given cortical location, the response properties of direction selectivity and preferred speed are derived from distinct neural processing mechanisms. Significant observations were also made between preferred FM sweep speed and excitatory bandwidth (i.e., Q10dB and Q40dB) such that units that responded best to slower FM speeds also seemed to have higher Q10dB and Q40dB (i.e.
   , were narrowly tuned) and vice versa. In addition, units that responded well to a broadband transient stimulus in general preferred faster FM sweeps and vice versa. Although these correlations were significant across the entire dorsoventral extent of Al investigated in this study, they were stronger for responses in the dorsal subregion of Al. For direction selectivity, statistically significant correlations with these response parameters were observed more often in the dorsal than the ventral regions of AI.  The apparent spatial segregation of neuronal responses to different FM sweep speeds and sweep directions distributed along the isofrequency domain of AI suggests that the global aspects of cortical function are compatible with psychopliysically derived notions of parallel streams of processing for different aspects of FM signals.

TI Multidimensional chemotopic responses to n-aliphatic acid odorants in
   the rat olfactory bulb
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB In an effort to understand the means by which similar chemical odorants are encoded in the mammalian brain, we exposed rats to a homologous series of n-aliphatic acids and mapped the response of the entire olfactory bulb glomerular layer by using a high-resolution [C-14]-2-deoxyglucose uptake technique. We found that these similar odorants evoked spatially clustered but distinct responses in the bulb that changed systematically with carbon chain length. In addition to these chemotopic responses, different odorants within the series evoked systematic differences along two other dimensions: amount of deoxyglucose uptake and extent of the glomerular layer showing high activity. Increases along these two dimensions also were correlated with increasing carbon number. The focal glomerular responses were mirrored by responses in deeper bulb layers. Decreasing the odorant concentration decreased the deoxyglucose uptake within focal regions. The focal regions of activity occurred in pairs involving both medial and lateral representations in the bulb, perhaps reflecting the paired medial and lateral projections of olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific types of odorant feature receptor proteins. The observed spatial pattern of response also may explain both the failure of some bulb lesions to interfere with behavioral olfactory responses and the success of other lesions in blocking olfactory responses. These data support a model of parallel, distributed processing of odorants along multiple dimensions. They also support the notion that analyses of the spatial relationships among odorant responses in the olfactory bulb can demonstrate aspects of the mechanism for odor chemical coding.

AB The effects of polysemy (number of meanings) and word frequency were examined in lexical decision and naming tasks. Polysemy effects were observed in both tasks. In the lexical decision task, high- and low-frequency words produced identical polysemy effects. In the naming task, however, polysemy interacted with frequency, with polysemy effects being limited to low-frequency words. When degraded stimuli were used in both tasks, the interaction appeared not only in naming but also in lexical decision. Because stimulus degradation also produced an effect of spelling-sound regularity in the lexical decision task, the different relationships between polysemy and frequency appear to be due to whether responding was based primarily on orthographic or phonological codes. As such, the effects of polysemy seem to be due to the nature of task-specific processes. An explanation in terms of M. S. Seidenberg and J. L. McClelland's (1989) and D. C. Plaut and J. L. McClelland's (1993) parallel distributed processing models is proposed.

TI Asymmetric segregation of numb in retinal development and the influence
   of the pigmented epithelium
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants during cytokinesis plays an important part in controlling cell-fate choice in invertebrates. During Drosophila neurogenesis, for example, asymmetric segregation of the Numb protein, which inhibits Notch signaling, is necessary for the two daughter cells of a division to have different fates. In vertebrates, the role of asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants is uncertain, and the way the process might be regulated is unknown. We have studied the orientation of cell divisions and the distribution of Numb in the developing rat retina. We show that, whereas most retinal neuroepithelial cells divide with their mitotic spindles oriented parallel to the plane of the neuroepithelium, a substantial minority divides with their spindles oriented perpendicularly. The proportion of these vertically dividing cells changes during development, peaking around the day of birth. Numb appears to be inherited only by the apical daughter cell when a neuroepithelial cell divides vertically. Similarly, in dissociated cell cultures, some retinal neuroepithelial cells divide asymmetrically and distribute Numb to only one of the two daughter cells, suggesting that the dissociated cells can retain their polarity in vitro. Using retinal explant cultures, we find that the retinal pigment epithelium apparently promotes vertical divisions in the neural retina. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants may contribute to cell diversification in the mammalian retina and that an epithelium controls this process by influencing the plane of division in the adjacent neural retina.

TI CATEGORIZATION BY A CONNECTIONIST NETWORK
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION
AB Three experiments tested a simple connectionist network approach to human categorization. The specific network considered consists of a layer of input nodes, each representing a feature of the exemplar to be categorized, connected in parallel to a layer of output nodes representing the categories. Learning to categorize exemplars consists of adjusting the weights in the network so as to increase the probability of making correct categorizations; weight changes are determined by the Rescorla-Wagner (1972) learning rule. The experiments used a simulated medical diagnosis procedure in which subjects have to decide which disease (the category) each of a series of patients is suffering from on the basis of the patients' symptoms (the features). After a series of trials, the subjects rated the extent to which particular symptoms were associated with particular diseases. In each of the experiments, it is shown that a process of selective learning occurs in this categorization task and that selection in turn depends on the relative predictiveness of the symptom for the disease. Such effects parallel results found in animal conditioning experiments and are readily reproduced by the connectionist network model. The results are also discussed in terms of a variety of traditional theories of categorization.

AB The effects of Simon- and Stroop-like stimuli are examined in isolation and in factorial combinations with different delays between the presentation of the irrelevant and the relevant stimuli. The effects of irrelevant stimuli have different time courses depending on whether they overlap with the relevant stimulus (stimulus-stimulus overlap, Dimensional Overlap [DO] Type 4) or with the response (stimulus-response overlap, DO type 3).

Osman, 1990), and it postulates a nonmonotone irrelevant stimulus activation function in addition to 2 temporally ordered, serial, nonindependent stages: a stimulus processing stage and a response production stage. DO'97 is able to simulate the temporal dynamic characteristics of the processes, with good fits to the empirical data. of this study and other published studies, at the level of means, variances, and distributional plots.

   TEMPORAL, AND CINGULATE CORTICES
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB The neurochemical characteristics of the neuronal subsets that furnish different types of corticocortical connections have been only partially determined. In recent years, several cytoskeletal proteins have emerged as reliable markers to distinguish subsets of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of primates. In particular, previous studies using an antibody to nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (SMI-32) have revealed a consistent degree of regional and laminar specificity in the distribution of a subpopulation of pyramidal cells in the primate cerebral cortex. The density of neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons was shown to vary across corticocortical pathways in macaque monkeys. In the present study, we have used the antibody SMI-32 to examine further and to quantify the distribution of a subset of corticocortically projecting neurons in a series of long ipsilateral corticocortical pathways in comparison to short corticocortical, commissural, and limbic connections. The results demonstrate that the long association pathways interconnecting the frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortex have a high representation of neurofilament protein-enriched pyramidal neurons (45-90%), whereas short corticocortical, callosal, and limbic pathways are characterized by much lower numbers of such neurons (4-35%). These data suggest that different types of corticocortical connections have differential representation of highly specific neuronal subsets that share common neurochemical characteristics, thereby determining regional and laminar cortical patterns of morphological and molecular heterogeneity. These differences in neuronal neurochemical phenotype among corticocortical circuits may have considerable influence on cortical processing and may be directly related to the type of integrative function subserved by each cortical pathway. Finally, it is worth noting that neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons are dramatically affected in the course of Alzheimer's disease. The present results support the hypothesis that neurofilament protein may be crucially linked to the development of selective neuronal vulnerability and subsequent disruption of corticocortical pathways that lead to the severe impairment of cognitive function commonly observed in age-related dementing disorders.

AB Recent functional studies question the validity of the hierarchical model of organization for processing visual information in cortical areas. The results of these studies suggest that beyond the primary visual cortex (V1), information is not serially processed through successive cortical areas, but that it is simultaneously processed in several areas. The idea that visual information is functionally segregated into different, parallel channels as it circulates through V1 and V2 towards V4 and the middle temporal visual area is also challenged by recent studies that report a smaller degree of functional specialization within the visual areas than previously thought.

The relative onset latencies of neural activity have been scrutinized for evidence of a functional hierarchy of sequentially recruited centers, but experiments reveal that activity changes occur largely in parallel. Neurons whose activity covaries with movement parameters have been sought for evidence of explicit coding of parameters such as active force, limb displacement, and behavioral set. Neurons with recognizable relations to the task are typically selected from a larger population, ignoring those cells with complex relations to the task and unmodulated cells. Selective interpretations are also used to support the notion that different motor regions perform different motor functions, again, current evidence suggests that units with similar properties are distributed over widely different regions.
   These coding issues are reexamined for premotoneuronal (Pre M) cells, whose correlational links with motoneurons are revealed by spike-triggered averages. Pre M cells are recruited over long times relative to their target muscles, they show diverse response patterns relative to the muscle force they produce, functionally disparate PreM cells such as afferent fibers and descending corticomotoneuronal and rubromotoneuronal cells can exhibit similar patterns. Neural mechanisms have been further elucidated by neural network simulations of sensorimotor behavior, the pre-output hidden units typically show diverse response patterns in relation to their target units. Thus, studies in which both the activity and the connectivity of the same units are known reveal that units with both simple and complex relations to the task contribute significantly to the output. This suggests that the search for explicit coding may be diverting us from understanding distributed neural mechanisms that operate without literal representations.

TI Understanding in an instant: Neurophysiological evidence for mechanistic
   language circuits in the brain
SO BRAIN AND LANGUAGE
AB How long does it take the human mind to grasp the idea when hearing or reading a sentence? Neurophysiological methods looking directly at the time course of brain activity indexes of comprehension are critical for finding the answer to this question. As the dominant cognitive approaches, models of serial/cascaded and parallel processing, make conflicting predictions on the time course of psycholinguistic information access, they can be tested using neurophysiological brain activation recorded in MEG and EEG experiments. Seriality and cascading of lexical, semantic and syntactic processes receives support from late (latency similar to 1/2 s) sequential neurophysiological responses, especially N400 and P600. However, parallelism is substantiated by early near-simultaneous brain indexes of a range of psycholinguistic processes, up to the level of semantic access and context integration, emerging already 100-250 ms after critical stimulus information is present. Crucially, however, there are reliable latency differences of 20-50 ms between early cortical area activations reflecting lexical, semantic and syntactic processes, which are left unexplained by current serial and parallel brain models of language. We here offer a mechanistic model grounded in cortical nerve cell circuits that builds upon neuroanatomical and neurophysiological knowledge and explains both near-simultaneous activations and fine-grained delays. A key concept is that of discrete distributed cortical circuits with specific inter-area topographies. The full activation, or ignition, of specifically distributed binding circuits explains the near-simultaneity of early neurophysiological indexes of lexical, syntactic and semantic processing. Activity spreading within circuits determined by between-area conduction delays accounts for comprehension-related regional activation differences in the millisecond range. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI Deficits in irregular past-tense verb morphology associated with
   degraded semantic knowledge
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB Two distinct mechanisms are often considered necessary to account for generation of the past-tense of English verbs: a lexical associative process For irregular forms like speak --> spoke, and a rule-governed process ('add -ed') for regular and novel forms like talk --> talked and wug --> wugged. An alternative account based on a parallel-distributed processing approach proposes that one complex procedure processes all past-tense types. In this alternative view, neuropsychological dissociations are explained by reduced input from word meaning that plays a greater role in successful generation of the past-tense for lower frequency irregular verbs, and by phonological deficits that disproportionately affect regular and novel forms. Only limited evidence has been available concerning the relationship between knowledge of word meaning and verb-tense processing. The study reported here evaluated the past-tense verb abilities of ii patients with semantic dementia, a neurodegenerative condition characterised by degraded semantic knowledge. We predicted and confirmed that the patients would have essentially normal ability to generate and recognise regular land novel past-tense Forms, bur a marked and frequency-modulated deficit on irregular verbs. Across the set of 11 patients, the degree of impairment for the irregular past-tense was significantly correlated with the degree of comprehension impairment as measured by verb synonym judgements. These results. plus other features of the data such as the nature of the errors to irregular verbs, are discussed in relation to currently developing theories of the language system.

TI SENSITIVITY OF NEURONS IN CAT PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX TO TONES AND
   FREQUENCY-MODULATED STIMULI .2. ORGANIZATION OF RESPONSE PROPERTIES
   ALONG THE ISOFREQUENCY DIMENSION
SO HEARING RESEARCH
AB The spatial distribution of neuronal responses to tones and frequency-modulated (FM) stimuli was mapped along the 'isofrequency' dimension of the primary auditory cortex (AI) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats. In each cat, electrode penetrations roughly orthogonal to the cortical surface were closely spaced (average separation almost-equal-to 130 mum) along the dorsoventral extent of a single 'isofrequency' strip in high frequency parts of AI ( > 15 kHz). Characteristic frequency (CF), minimum threshold, sharpness of frequency tuning (Q10 and Q20), the dynamic range of the spike count-intensity function at CF, sensitivity to the rate of change of frequency (RCF) and to the direction of frequency-modulation (DS) were determined for contralaterally-presented tone and FM stimuli. Sharpness of tuning attained maximum values at central loci along the dorsoventral 'isofrequency' axis and values declined towards more dorsal and more ventral locations. Minimum threshold and dynamic range varied between high and low values in a similar and correlated periodic fashion. Their combined organization yielded an orderly spatial representation of response strength, relative to maximum, as a function of stimulus amplitude. The distributions of the most common forms of FM rate sensitivity (RCF response categories) and best RCF along 'isofrequency' strips were significantly non-random although there was a considerable degree of variability between cats. FM directional preference and sensitivity appeared to be randomly distributed. Sharpness of tuning may be related to the analysis of the spectral content of an acoustic stimulus, both minimum threshold and dynamic range are related to the encoding of stimulus intensity, and measures of FM rate and directional sensitivity assess the coding of temporal changes of stimulus spectra. The independent, or for minimum threshold and dynamic range dependent, topographic organizations of these neuronal parameters therefore suggest parallel and independent processing of these aspects of acoustic signals, in AI.

TI The neural correlates of conscious vision
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB Conflicting accounts of the neurobiology of consciousness have emerged from previous imaging studies. Some studies suggest that visual consciousness relates to a distributed network of frontal and partietal regions while others point to localized activity within individual visual areas. While the two positions seem mutually exclusive, timing issues may help reconcile the two. Networks that appear unified in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies may reflect processes that are widely distributed in time. To help resolve this issue, we have investigated timing across a network correlating with consciousness in parallel fMRI and evoked potential (EP) studies of grating stimuli. At threshold, a stimulus is perceived on some occasions but not on others, dissociating sensory input and perception. We have found correlates of consciousness in the occipital lobe at 100 ms and in parietal, frontal, auditory and motor regions from 260 ms onwards. The broad temporal and spatial distribution of activity argues against a unified, distributed fronto-parietal correlate of consciousness. Instead, it suggests that correlates of consciousness are divided into primary and secondary network nodes, with early activity in the occipital lobe correlating with perception and later activity in downstream areas with secondary processes contingent on the outcome of earlier perceptual processing.

TI A parallel distributed processing model of stimulus-stimulus and
   stimulus-response compatibility
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB A parallel distributed processing (PDP) model is proposed to account for choice reaction time (RT) performance in diverse cognitive and perceptual tasks such as the Stroop task, the Simon task, the Eriksen flanker task, and the stimulus-response compatibility task that are interrelated in terms of stimulus-stimulus and stimulus-response overlap (Kornblum, 1992). In multilayered;(input-intermediate-output) networks, neuron-like nodes that represent stimulus and response features are grouped into mutually inhibitory modules that represent stimulus and response dimensions. The stimulus-stimulus overlap is implemented by a convergence of two input modules onto a common intermediate module, and the stimulus-response overlap by direct pathways representing automatic priming of outputs. Mean RTs are simulated in various simple tasks and, furthermore, predictions are generated for complex tasks based on performance in simpler tasks. The match between simulated and experimental results lends strong support for our PDP model of compatibility. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

TI Multistage model for binocular rivalry
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Binocular rivalry is the alternating perception that occurs when incompatible stimuli are presented to the two eyes: one monocular stimulus dominates vision and then the other stimulus dominates, with a perceptual switch occurring every few seconds. There is a need for a binocular rivalry model that accounts for both well- established results on the timing of dominance intervals and for more recent evidence on the distributed neural processing of rivalry. The model for binocular rivalry developed here consists of four parallel visual channels, two driven by the left eye and two by the right. Each channel consists of several consecutive processing stages representing successively higher cortical levels, with mutual inhibition between the channels at each stage. All stages are architecturally identical. With n the number of stages, the model is implemented as 4n nonlinear differential equations using a total of eight parameters. Despite the simplicity of its architecture, the model accounts for a variety of experimental observations: 1) the increasing depth of rivalry at higher cortical areas, as shown in electrophysiological, imaging, and psychophysical experiments; 2) the unimodal probability density of dominance durations, where the mode is less than the mean; 3) the lack of correlation between successive dominance durations; 4) the effect of interocular stimulus differences on dominance duration; and 5) eye suppression, as opposed to feature suppression. The model is potentially applicable to issues of visual processing more general than binocular rivalry.

TI Parvalbumin, calbindin, or calretinin in cortically projecting and
   GABAergic, cholinergic, or glutamatergic basal forebrain neurons of the
   rat
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB The basal forebrain (BF) plays an important role in modulating cortical activity and facilitating processes of attention, learning, and memory. This role is subserved by cholinergic neurons but also requires the participation of other noncholinergic neurons. Noncholinergic neurons include gamma-amino butyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, some of which project in parallel with the cholinergic cells to the cerebral cortex, others of which project caudally or locally. With the original aim of distinguishing different subgroups of GABAergic neurons, we examined immunostaining for the calcium binding proteins (CBPs) parvalbumin (Parv), calbindin (Calb), and calretinin (Calret) in the rat. Although the CBP+ cell groups were distributed in a coextensive manner with the GABAergic cells, they were collectively more numerous. Of cells retrogradely labeled with cholera toxin (CT) from the prefrontal or parietal cortex, Parv(+) and Calb(+) cells, but not Calret(+) cells, represented substantial proportions (similar to35-45% each) that collectively were greater than that of GABAergic projection neurons. From dual immunostaining for the CBPs and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), it appeared that the vast majority (>90%) of the Parv(+) group was GAD(+), whereas only a small minority (<10%) of the Calb(+) or Calret(+) group was GAD(+). Significant proportions of Calb(+) (>40%) and Calret+ (>80%) neurons were immunopositive for phosphate-activated glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for transmitter glutamate. The results suggested that, whereas Calret(+) cells predominantly comprise caudally or locally projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons, Parv(+) cells likely comprise the cortically projecting GABAergic BF neurons and Calb(+) cells the cortically projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons that would collectively participate with the cholinergic cells in the modulation of cortical activity.

TI A Parallel and Distributed-Processing Model of Joint Attention, Social
   Cognition and Autism
SO AUTISM RESEARCH
AB The impaired development of joint attention is a cardinal feature of autism. Therefore, understanding the nature of joint attention is central to research on this disorder. joint attention may be best defined in terms of an information-processing system that begins to develop by 4-6 months of age. This system integrates the parallel processing of internal information about one's own visual attention with external information about the visual attention of other people. This type of joint encoding of information about self and other attention requires the activation of a distributed anterior and posterior cortical attention network. Genetic regulation, in conjunction with self-organizing behavioral activity, guides the development of functional connectivity in this network. With practice in infancy the joint processing of self-other attention becomes automatically engaged as an executive function. It can be argued that this executive joint attention is fundamental to human learning as well as the development of symbolic thought, social cognition and social competence throughout the life span. One advantage of this parallel and distributed-processing model of joint attention is that it directly connects theory on social pathology to a range of phenomena in autism associated with neural connectivity, constructivist and connectionist models of cognitive development, early intervention, activity-dependent gene expression and atypical ocular motor control.

TI Sublaminar organization of the mouse olfactory bulb nerve layer
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB Olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons coalesce to form the olfactory nerve (ON) and then grow from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb (OB), enter the olfactory nerve layer (ONL), reorganize extensively, and innervate specific glomeruli. Within the ON and ONL a population of glial cells, the olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), surround OSN axon fascicles. To better understand the relationship between OECs and axon fascicles in the ONL of the adult mouse, we used confocal microscopy and antibodies to the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75 (p75), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and S-100 to identify glia. Antibodies to olfactory marker protein (OMP) and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) were used to identify OSN axons. Electron microscopy characterized the ONL ultrastructure. We found that glial processes were not uniformly distributed in the ONL of the mouse. The p75(+) OEC processes were restricted to the ON and the outer ONL sublamina, and oriented parallel to the plane of the OB layers. In the inner ONL NPY OEC-like processes were seen. GFAP(+) processes were restricted to the inner ONL sublamina, the ONL/GL boundary, and the GL, where they delineated loosely aggregated axon fascicles that entered the glomeruli obliquely. S-100(+) processes and somata were distributed throughout the ONL; the outer and inner ONL were equivalent in their S-100 staining. Ultrastructural studies showed that, although OECs could be identified in both the outer and inner ONL, in the latter, their relationship to bundles of OEC axons appeared less orderly than seen in the outer ONL. Our data demonstrate a differential organization of the ONL that could subserve distinct functions; axon extension may occur predominately in the outermost ONL, whereas glomerular targeting occurs in the inner sublamina of the ONL.

TI Evolution of Alzheimer's disease-related cytoskeletal changes in the
   basal nucleus of Meynert
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB This study examines the evolution of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology in a subcortical predilection site, the basal nucleus of Meynert (bnM), which is a major source of cortical cholinergic innervation. Brains of 51 autopsy cases were studied using silver techniques and immunostaining for tau-associated neurofibrillary pathology and for amyloid beta protein (A beta) deposits. All cases are classified according to a procedure permitting differentiation of six stages of AD-related neurofibrillary changes in the cerebral cortex. Initial cytoskeletal abnormalities in the bnM are already noted in stage I of cortical neurofibrillary changes. The gradual development of the neurofibrillary pathology in the bnM parallels the progression of the AD-related stages in the cerebral cortex. A variety of morphologically distinguishable cytoskeletal alterations are observed in large nerve cells which predominate in the bnM. Based on these cellular alterations, a sequence of cytoskeletal deterioration is proposed. Initially, the abnormal tau protein is distributed diffusely throughout the cell body and the neuronal processes. Subsequently, it aggregates to form a neurofibrillary tangle, which appears as a spherical somatic inclusion. The cell processes gradually become fragmented. Finally the parent cell dies, leaving behind an extraneuronal "ghost tangle". With regard to the cortical stages of AD-related neurofibrillary changes, the initial forms of cytoskeletal changes in the bnM predominate in the transentorhinal AD stages (I and II), while "ghost tangles" preferentially occur in the neocortical stages (V and VI). The considerable morphological diversity of cytoskeletal alterations is typical of stages III and IV. These results indicate that individual neurons of the bnM enter the sequence of cytoskeletal deterioration at different times.

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RECEPTIVE AND DENDRITIC FIELD SIZE OF AMACRINE
   CELLS IN THE RABBIT RETINA
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB 1. Intracellular recordings were obtained from 40 amacrine cells in the isolated, superfused retina eyecup of the rabbit. Cells were subsequently labeled with horseradish peroxidase for morphological identification. Many of these cells displayed dendritic morphology consistent with that of amacrine cells described in prior anatomic studies, including starburst, A17, AII, and DAPI-3 cells.
   2. The center receptive field of amacrine cells was measured with a 50- or 95-mum-wide, 6.0-mm-long rectangular slit of light that was displaced along its minor axis (parallel to the visual streak) in increments as small as 3 mum. The extent of the receptive field was calculated as the total distance over which the displaced slit could evoke a center response. Area summation of amacrine cells was measured with concentric spots of light with increasing diameters centered over the cell.
   3. For a single amacrine cell, the receptive field size was comparable to the extent of its dendritic arbor. For the total population of amacrine cells, there was a strong, linear relationship between receptive field and dendritic field size. The receptive fields were, on average, 27% larger than the corresponding dendritic arbors, but this discrepancy can be accounted for entirely by tissue shrinkage associated with histological processing and a small imprecision of the light stimuli. Area summation measurements were consistent with those of receptive fields and were also related linearly to the dendritic field size of cells.
   4. These findings indicate that even when the slit of light was placed at the distal edges of the dendritic arbor, synaptic inputs activated there were propagated effectively to the soma and recorded by microelectrodes placed there. In addition, amacrine cells were capable of summating synaptic inputs distributed throughout the entire arbor.
   5. These results are inconsistent with the findings of prior computational modeling studies of passive, dendritic current flow in A17 and starburst amacrine cells that synaptic inputs on distal dendritic branches are isolated electrically from the soma and that these branches form autonomous, functional subunits.
   6. The majority of amacrine cells encountered displayed light-evoked and/or spontaneous action potentials. These action potentials often took the form of high-amplitude somatic and low-amplitude dendritic spikes. On average, spiking amacrine cells showed considerably larger dendritic fields than nonspiking amacrine cells. In fact, all amacrine cells with arbors > 436 mum, which formed 45% of the total population, displayed spike activity. These data suggest that spike generation is a feature common to most medium- and large-field amacrine cells, permitting active propagation of synaptic currents over distances often > 1 mm.
   7. Thus the discrepancy between the present electrophysiological data and those of prior modeling studies may be explained by the fact that synaptic inputs to most amacrine cells are not propagated passively within the arbor but rather by an active, regenerative process.

TI TONOTOPIC AND FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION IN THE AUDITORY-CORTEX OF THE BIG
   BROWN BAT, EPTESICUS-FUSCUS
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB 1.  In Eptesicus the auditory cortex, as defined by electrical activity recorded from microelectrodes in response to tone bursts, FM sweeps, and combinations of FM sweeps, encompasses an average cortical surface area of 5.7 mm2.  This area is large with respect to the total cortical surface area and reflects the importance of auditory processing to this species of bat.
   2.  The predominant pattern of organization in response to tone bursts observed in each cortex is tonotopic, with three discernible divisions revealed by our data.  However, although cortical best-frequency (BF) maps from most of the individual bats are similar, no two maps are identical.  The largest division contains an average of 84% of the auditory cortical surface area, with BF tonotopically mapped from high to low along the anteroposterior axis and is part of the primary auditory cortex.  The medium division encompasses an average of 13% of the auditory cortical surface area, with highly variable BF organization across bats.  The third region is the smallest, with an average of only 3% of auditory cortical surface area and is located at the anterolateral  edge of the cortex.  The region is marked by a reversal of the tonotopic axis and a restriction in the range of BFs as compared with the larger, tonotopically organized division.
   3.  A population of cortical neurons was found (n = 39) in which each neuron exhibited two BF threshold minima (BF1 and BF2) in response to tone bursts.  These neurons thus have multipeaked frequency threshold tuning curves.  In Eptesicus the majority of multipeaked frequency-tuned neurons (n = 27) have threshold minima at frequencies that correspond to a harmonic ratio of three-to-one.  In contrast, the majority of multipeaked neurons in cats have threshold minima at frequencies in a ratio of three-to-two. A three-to-one harmonic ratio corresponds to the ''spectral notches'' produced by interference between overlapping echoes from multiple reflective surfaces in complex sonar targets.  Behavioral experiments have demonstrated the ability of Eptesicus to use spectral interference notches for perceiving target shape, and this subpopulation of multipeaked frequency-tuned neurons may be involved in coding of spectral notches.
   4.  The auditory cortex contains delay-tuned neurons that encode target range (n = 99).  Most delay-tuned neurons respond poorly to tones or individual FM sweeps and require combinations of FM sweeps.  They are combination sensitive and delay tuned.  The response of cortical delay-tuned neurons is phasic with an average of 1.1 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) action potentials per pulse-echo pair.  Thus delay-tuned neurons act as coincidence detectors without additional facilitation.
   5.  The distribution of best echo delays (BDs) of cortical delay-tuned neurons appears bimodal, with neurons in the first mode (n = 33) encompassing BDs from 2 to approximately 11 ms and the second mode (n = 66) from approximately 11 to 28 ms.  The distribution of BDs in the first mode is similar to the range of BDs seen in other species of bats, but the distribution of BDs encompassed by the second mode appears unique and suggests a longer working range for echolocation in this species.  As an ensemble, cortical delay-tuned neurons encode target ranges of 34-484 cm, corresponding to the behaviorally observed 5-m limit for the detection of insect-sized objects.
   6.  Delay-tuned neurons in the tonotopically organized area (n = 36) typically exhibit shorter BDs and longer echo facilitation latencies (EFLs) than delay-tuned neurons in the variable frequency area (n = 48).  These differences are statistically significant and suggest that delay-tuned neurons in the variable and tonotopic regions constitute separate, multiple representations of target range information.
   7.  The distribution of BDs delay-tuned neurons is not topographically arrayed across the auditory cortex, at least not on the same large scale as tonotopic frequency organization.
   8.  Some (13 out of 25 tested) delay-tuned neurons systematically shifted their BDs in response to changes in the simulated pulse amplitude.  These delay-tuned neurons are termed ''amplitude shift'' neurons.  Of the 13 amplitude shift neurons, 11 exhibited a decrease in BD in response to decreasing pulse amplitudes, and 2 exhibited an increase in BD in response to decreasing pulse amplitudes.  Amplitude shift cells shifted their BD by an average 11 +/- 8 ms for an average change of 13 +/- 8 dB SPL.  The location of amplitude shift cells appears randomly distributed among delay-tuned neurons in the variable and tonotopic areas.
   9.  We develop a conceptual framework to understand the nontopographic organization of BDs by considering the overlapping multipeaked frequency-tuned and delay-tuned cortical fields in Eptesicus as parallel spectral and temporal components of a target range imaging process.

TI LTP maintenance and its protein synthesis-dependence
SO NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY
AB The properties of long-term potentiation (LTP) mirror those of associative memory in a number of interesting ways. Although plasticity at monosynaptic connections is not expected to account for the varied subtle characteristics of distributed memories, nonetheless it is important to establish how far the parallels can be drawn. Here, we briefly address whether properties of LTP such as its duration, reversibility, savings and reconsolidation relate to corresponding memory phenomena. We then address whether LTP stabilization in fact requires protein synthesis, as this has been challenged in recent times much like the necessity for protein synthesis in the consolidation of long-term memory has been queried. We conclude that the case is still very strong for a necessary role of protein synthesis in LTP stabilization, even though the identities of the synthesized proteins and their contributions to the LTP process are not fully understood. However, we highlight areas of research that could be usefully conducted to further our understanding of the properties and protein synthesis-dependence of LTP. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI PHYSIOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY OF COMPLEX SPIKING NEURONS IN THE GUINEA-PIG
   DORSAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB Intracellular recordings from the dorsal cochlear nucleus have identified cells with both simple and complex action potential waveforms. We investigated the hypothesis that cartwheel cells are a specific cell type that generates complex action potentials, based on their analogous anatomical, developmental, and biochemical similarities to cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are known to discharge complex action potentials. Intracellular recordings were made from a brain slice preparation of the guinea pig dorsal cochlear nucleus. A subpopulation of cells discharged a series of two or three action potentials riding on a slow depolarization as an all-or-none event; this discharge pattern is called a complex spike or burst. These cells also exhibited anodal break bursts, anomalous rectification, subthreshold inward rectification, and frequent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Seven complex-spiking cells were stained with intracellular dyes and subsequently identified as cartwheel neurons. In contrast, six identified simple-spiking cells recorded in concurrent experiments were pyramidal cells.
   The cartwheel cell bodies reside in the lower part of layer 1 and the upper part of layer 2 of the nucleus. The cells are characterized by spiny dendrites penetrating the molecular layer, a lack of basal dendritic processes, and an axonal plexus invading layers 2 and 3, and the inner regions of layer 1. The cartwheel cell axons made putative synaptic contacts at the light microscopic level with pyramidal cells and small cells, including stellate cells, granule cells, and other cartwheel cells in layers 1 and 2. The axonal plexus of individual cartwheel cells suggests that they can inhibit cells receiving input from either the same or adjacent parallel fibers and that this inhibition is distributed along the isofrequency contours of the nucleus.

TI Disconnection in prosopagnosia and face processing
SO CORTEX
AB Face perception is a function with significant complexity, reflected in cognitive models that propose a hierarchy of parallel and serial processing stages. Current neuroimaging data also show that face perception involves a core processing network of cortical modules, which are likely specialized for different functions involved in face processing. The core face processing network is further linked to an extended face processing network which is not solely involved in the perception of faces, but rather contains modules mediating the processing of semantic, biographic and emotional information about people. The segregation of these processes within discrete anatomic regions creates the potential for disconnection between regions to generate neuropsychological deficits involving faces. In this review we consider the types of disconnection possible both within the core face processing system and between the core and extended systems, the pattern of deficits that would be considered as evidence of such disconnections, the potential anatomy of lesions that would create them, and whether any cases exist that meet these criteria.

TI Organizing principles of cortical integration in the rat neostriatum:
   Corticostriate map of the body surface is an ordered lattice of curved
   laminae and radial points
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
AB The neuroanatomic organizing principles underlying integrative functions in the striatum are only partially understood. Within the three major subdivisions of the striatum-sensorimotor, associative, and limbic-longitudinal zones of axonal plexuses from the cerebral cortex end in bands and clusters that innervate cell groups. To identify organizing principles of the corticostriate bands and clusters, are localized somatosensory cortical cells receptive to light touch on the hindlimb, forelimb, or vibrissae by extracellular recording, and we labeled their projections by iontophoretic application of dextran anterograde tracers. The results show that cortical cells in columnar groups project to the striatum in the form of successive strips, or laminae, that parallel the curve of the external capsule. The vibrissae somatosensory cortex projects to the most lateral lamina. Just medial to the vibrissae projection, the major axonal arborizations arising from hindlimb and forelimb somatosensory cortex are organized within a common lamina, where they interdigitate and overlap as well as remain separate. In addition, the hindlimb and forelimb cortex send small projections to the vibrissae lamina, and vice versa, forming broken, radially oriented lines of points across the laminar strips. The major somatosensory projections are in the dorsolateral, calbindin-poor sensorimotor striatum, whereas the radially oriented projection points extend into the medial, calbindin-rich associative striatum. Extending previous studies of corticostriate projections, this report shows a grid translation of columnar somatosensory cortical inputs into striatum and a detailed map for the rat sensorimotor zone. The lattice-like grid is a novel functional/neuroanatomic organization that is ideal for distributing, combining, and integrating information for sensorimotor and cognitive processing.

TI INFORMATION-PROCESSING FOR MOTOR CONTROL IN PRIMATE PREMOTOR CORTEX
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Recent neurophysiological as well as neuropsychological studies provided evidences on how various informations are processed to generate motor programs in the central nervous system. In this article, functional specializations of two distinct cortical motor areas, the dorsal and ventral aspects of the premotor cortex (PMd and PMv, respectively) of macaque monkeys, are focused to review this issue. Three major conclusions emerged from recent neurophysiological studies. First, each of movement parameters such as amplitude and direction is distinctively programmed in PMd by serial integration, rather than by parallel distributed processing. Second, in performance of conditional motor behavior, conditionally presented sensory signals are processed for motor preparation and execution of an intended act in PMd, but not in PMv. Third, PMv may be specialized for motor execution under visual guidance.

TI Development of eye-movement control
SO BRAIN AND COGNITION
AB Cognitive control of behavior continues to improve through adolescence in parallel with important brain maturational processes including synaptic pruning and myelination, which allow for efficient neuronal computations and the functional integration of widely distributed circuitries supporting top-down control of behavior. This is also a time when psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, emerge reflecting a particularly vulnerability to impairments in development during adolescence. Oculomotor studies provide a unique neuroscientific approach to make precise associations between cognitive control and brain circuitry during development that can inform us of impaired systems in psychopathology, In this review, we first describe the development Of pursuit, fixation, and visually-guided saccadic eye movements, which collectively indicate early maturation of basic sensorimotor processes supporting reflexive, exogenously-driven eye movements. We then describe the literature on the development of the cognitive control of eye movements as reflected in the ability to inhibit a prepotent eye movement in the antisaccade task, as well as making an eye movement guided by on-line spatial information in working memory in the oculomotor delayed response task. Results indicate that the ability to make eye movements in a voluntary fashion driven by endogenous plans shows a protracted development into adolescence. Characterizing the transition through adolescence to adult-level cognitive control of behavior can inform models aimed at understanding the neurodevelopmental basis of psychiatric disorders.

TI Good vibrations: Tactile feedback in support of attention allocation and
   human-automation coordination in event-driven domains
SO HUMAN FACTORS
AB Observed breakdowns in human-machine communication can be explained, in part, by the nature of current automation feedback, which relies heavily on focal visual attention. Such feedback is not well suited for capturing attention in case of unexpected changes and events or for supporting the parallel processing of large amounts of data in complex domains. As suggested by multiple-resource theory, one possible solution to this problem is to distribute information across various sensory modalities. A simulator study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of visual, tactile, and redundant visual and tactile cues for indicating unexpected changes in the status of an automated cockpit system. Both tactile conditions resulted in higher detection rates for, and faster response times to, uncommanded mode transitions. Tactile feedback did not interfere with, nor was its effectiveness affected by, the performance of concurrent visual tasks. The observed improvement in task-sharing performance indicates that the introduction of tactile feedback is a promising avenue toward better supporting human-machine communication in event-driven, information-rich domains.

TI Recognition memory in rats - II. Neuroanatomical substrates
SO PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB A discussion of the neuroanatomical systems thought to be of importance for the mediation of recognition memory in the rat warrants consideration of different, but not necessarily exclusive concepts. An important concept is the hypothesis that a dichotomy in the neural systems mediating spatial and non-spatial (item) memory exists in the rat. We have adopted a model of recognition memory suggesting that information about previously encountered items is stored in a dynamic pattern of neural activity and not in a localized representation, These patterns are features of distributed neuronal networks and different networks may process different forms of recognition memory. Two parallel-distributed neuronal networks are proposed in the rat. Network 1 is essential for the processing of non-spatial/item recognition memory processes and incorporates the cortical association areas such as TE1, TE2 and TE3, the rhinal cortices, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and prefrontal cortical areas. Network 2 comprises the hippocampus, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei and medial prefrontal areas, especially the prelimbic cortex, and is suggested to, be pivotal for the processing of spatial recognition memory.

TI CALRETININ IMMUNOREACTIVITY IN THE MONKEY HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION .1.
   LIGHT AND ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS AND COLOCALIZATION WITH
   OTHER CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB Calretinin-containing neurons were visualized by immunocytochemistry in the monkey hippocampal formation, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex. Calretinin-immunoreactivity was present exclusively in non-granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in non-pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn, subiculum and entorhinal cortex. Most frequently, calretinin-positive neurons were found at the hilar border of the dentate granule cell layer and in the stratum radiatum of CA1-3 areas. In the subicular complex, immunoreactive neurons were evenly distributed in all layers, whereas in the entorhinal cortex, they were accumulated in external layers above the lamina dissecans. Distinct bands of calretinin-positive fibers occupied the supragranular zone of the molecular layer in dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of the CA2 area in Ammon's horn and the upper two layers of presubiculum. The majority of calretinin-immunoreactive neurons were small, bipolar or fusiform neurons with a dendritic tree oriented parallel to the dendrites of principal cells (granule cells in dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons elsewhere). Dendrites were smooth or sparsely spiny, displaying small spines of conventional type. Co-existence studies showed that these neurons were completely devoid of other calcium-binding proteins, parvalbumin and calbindin.
   Electron microscopic analysis revealed somata of immunoreactive neurons which contained a large nucleus and a small cytoplasmic rim, which contained only few organelles. The nucleus displayed deep infoldings and intranuclear rods. Input synapses of immunoreactive neurons were rare both on somata and dendrites and large surface areas were frequently apposed by glial processes. This was very prominent in the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn. Axons of calretinin-positive neurons were thin, arborized in all layers and had small varicosities. Their terminals formed symmetric synaptic contacts mainly with dendrites and less frequently with somata of principal cells. Axon terminals of calretinin-immunoreactive fiber bundles in the supragranular layer, as well as in the pyramidal layer of the CA2 area, formed asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts. In addition, they established asymmetric axospinous and axosomatic synaptic contacts with granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the presubiculum, the calretinin-positive axon bundle included a large number of immunoreactive myelinated axons, as well as axon terminals.
   The characteristic location and features of synapses suggests that these fibers derive from extra-hippocampal afferents (Nitsch, R. and Leranth C. (1993) Neuroscience 55, 797-812) and not from the calretinin-immunoreactive neurons of the hippocampal formation.

TI Combined effects of attention and motivation on visual task performance:
   transient and sustained motivational effects
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB We investigated how the brain integrates motivational and attentional signals by using a neuroimaging paradigm that provided separate estimates for transient cue- and target-related signals, in addition to sustained block-related responses. Participants performed a Posner-type task in which an endogenous cue predicted target location on 70% of trials, while motivation was manipulated by varying magnitude and valence of a cash incentive linked to task performance. Our findings revealed increased detection performance (d') as a function of incentive value. In parallel, brain signals revealed that increases in absolute incentive magnitude led to cue- and target-specifi c response modulations that were independent of sustained state effects across visual cortex, fronto-parietal regions, and subcortical regions. Interestingly, state-like effects of incentive were observed in several of these brain regions, too, suggesting that both transient and sustained fMRI signals may contribute to task performance. For both cue and block periods, the effects of administering incentives were correlated with individual trait measures of reward sensitivity. Taken together, our findings support the notion that motivation improves behavioral performance in a demanding attention task by enhancing evoked responses across a distributed set of anatomical sites, many of which have been previously implicated in attentional processing. However, the effect of motivation was not simply additive as the impact of absolute incentive was greater during invalid than valid trials in several brain regions, possibly because motivation had a larger effect on reorienting than orienting attentional mechanisms at these sites.

TI Spatio temporal dynamics of face recognition
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB To better understand face recognition, it is necessary to identify not only which brain structures are implicated but also the dynamics of the neuronal activity in these structures. Latencies can then be compared to unravel the temporal dynamics of information processing at the distributed network level. To achieve high spatial and temporal resolution, we used intracerebral recordings in epileptic subjects while they performed a famous/unfamiliar face recognition task. The first components peaked at 110 ms in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and simultaneously in the inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting the early establishment of a large-scale network. This was followed by components peaking at 160 ms in 2 areas along the FG. Important stages of distributed parallel processes ensued at 240 and 360 ms involving up to 6 regions along the ventral visual pathway. The final components peaked at 480 ms in the hippocampus. These stages largely overlapped. Importantly, event-related potentials to famous faces differed from unfamiliar faces and control stimuli in all medial temporal lobe structures. The network was bilateral but more right sided. Thus, recognition of famous faces takes place through the establishment of a complex set of local and distributed processes that interact dynamically and may be an emergent property of these interactions.
