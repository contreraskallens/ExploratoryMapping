1		2015	friston k frith c	a duet for one	consciousness and cognition	this paper considers communication in terms of inference about the behaviour of others and our own behaviour it is based on the premise that our sensations are largely generated by other agents like ourselves this means we are trying to infer how our sensations are caused by others while they are trying to infer our behaviour for example in the dialogue between two speakers we suggest that the infinite regress induced by modelling another agent  who is modelling you  can be finessed if you both possess the same model in other words the sensations caused by others and oneself are generated by the same process this leads to a view of communication based upon a narrative that is shared by agents who are exchanging sensory signals crucially this narrative transcends agency and simply involves intermittently attending to and attenuating sensory input attending to sensations enables the shared narrative to predict the sensations generated by another ie to listen while attenuating sensory input enables one to articulate the narrative ie to speak this produces a reciprocal exchange of sensory signals that formally induces a generalised synchrony between internal neuronal brain states generating predictions in both agents we develop the arguments behind this perspective using an active  inference framework and offer some simulations of birdsong as proof of principle

4		2013	joffily m coricelli g	emotional valence and the freeenergy principle	plos  biology	the freeenergy principle has recently been proposed as a unified  account of perception learning and action despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework a core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects in the present paper we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of freeenergy over time if the second timederivative of freeenergy is taken into account the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness unhappiness hope fear disappointment and relief can be explained in this formulation an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs when sensations increasingly violate the agent expectations valence is negative and increases the learning rate conversely when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent expectations valence is positive and decreases the learning rate this dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents adaptation to unexpected changes in their world

6		2011	ashourian p loewenstein y	 inference underlies the contraction bias in delayed comparison tasks	plos one	delayed comparison tasks are widely used in the study of working memory and perception in psychology and neuroscience it has long been known however that decisions in these tasks are biased when the two stimuli in a delayed comparison trial are small in magnitude subjects tend to report that the first stimulus is larger than the second stimulus in contrast subjects tend to report that the second stimulus is larger than the first when the stimuli are relatively large here we study the  principles underlying this bias also known as the contraction bias we propose that the contraction bias results from a  computation in which a noisy representation of a magnitude is combined with apriori information about the distribution of magnitudes to optimize performance we test our hypothesis on choice behavior in a visual delayed comparison experiment by studying the effect of i changing the prior distribution and ii changing the uncertainty in the memorized stimulus we show that choice behavior in both manipulations is consistent with the performance of an observer who uses a  inference in order to improve performance moreover our results suggest that the contraction bias arises during memory retrievaldecision making and not during memory encoding these results support the notion that the contraction bias illusion can be understood as resulting from optimality considerations

9		2004	lee md	a  analysis of retention functions	journal of mathematical psychology	a long standing goal of quantitative research in cognitive psychology has been to provide a lawful description of the retention of information over time while a number of theoretical alternatives for a retention function have been developed their empirical evaluation has almost exclusively relied on their ability to fit experimental data this has meant that the issue of model complexity which considers the number of parameter in a model and the functional form of parameter interaction has generally not been considered in a rigorous way this paper develops a  method for comparing retention models that naturally considers the competing demands of goodnessoffit and complexity we first implement the  method using numerical techniques highlighting the basic properties of the method and showing in particular how assumptions about the precision of the data affect the inferences that are drawn we then develop an analytic  method based on the laplacian approximation that offers some theoretical insights into the inherent complexities of different retention functions and has the practical advantage of being ly efficient we demonstrate both methods by evaluating linear hyperbolic exponential logarithmic and power retention functions against the collection of data sets considered by rubin and wenzel 1996

35		2014	haykin s fuster jm	on cognitive dynamic systems cognitive neuroscience and engineering learning from each other	proceedings of the ieee	cognitive dynamic systems provide a broadly defined platform whereby engineering learns from cognitive neuroscience and by the same token cognitive neuroscience learns from engineering the first part of the paper is of a tutorial nature addressing recent advances in cognitive perception and cognitive control which are the dual of each other the study of cognitive perception viewed from the perspective of  inference starts with sparse coding well known in neuroscience however sparse coding could become illposed particularly when the signaltonoise ratio is low in such situations stability is a necessary requirement which can only be satisfied if there is sufficient information in the observables to satisfy this requirement the sparsecoding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information filtering ie a special case of  filtering accordingly the performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of perceptual attention this improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor to separate relevant information from irrelevant information next moving into cognitive control viewed from the perspective of bellman dynamic programming two ideas are exploited entropic state of the perceptor and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two entropic states namely the current state and its immediate past value the net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of bellman dynamic programming and therefore a new reinforcement learning algorithm which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms but also offers some highly desirable properties among them is a linear law of  complexity which is the best that it could be the second part of the paper addresses two challenging problems first how to mediate between cognitive control and cognitive perception and second how to formulate a procedure for risk control the first problem is resolved by making use of probabilistic reasoning a branch of probability theory which leads into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine with this mediation in place the conditions for overall system stability are derived thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the overall system stabilizer the second challenge is risk control which is by far the most challenging of them all in the presence of an unexpected disturbance in the environment risk is brought under control by mimicking the predict and preadapt function which is considered to be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain to be specific motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new preadaptive control mechanism which involves two different sets of actions one set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy in the motor control the other set involves a window of experiences ie optimal actions gained in the past in a novel way by exploiting these two sets we end up with a preadaptive control mechanism in the form of a closedloop feedback structure which brings with it control executive attention

103		2002	bowers js	challenging the widespread assumption that  and  representations go handinhand	cognitive psychology	one of the central claims associated with the parallel  processing approach popularized by de rumelhart jl mcclelland and the pdp research group is that knowledge is coded in a  fashion localist representations within this perspective are widely rejected it is important to note however that connectionist networks can learn localist representations and many connectionist models depend on localist coding for their functioning accordingly a commitment to  representations should be considered a specific theoretical claim regarding the structure of knowledge rather than a core principle as often assumed in this paper it is argued that there are fundamental  and empirical challenges that have not yet been addressed by  connectionist theories that are readily accommodated within localist approaches this is highlighted in the context of modeling word and nonword naming the domain in which some of the strongest claims have been made it is shogun that current pdp models provide a poor account of naming monosyllable items and that  representations make it difficult for these models to scale lip to more complex language phenomena at the same time models that learn localist representations are shown to hold promise in supporting many of the core reading and language functions on which pdp models fail it is concluded that the common rejection of localist coding schemes within connectionist architectures is premature

107		1997	brown gda	 phonology reading and regularity in developmental dyslexia	brain and language	tests of the phonological deficit account of developmental dyslexia have produced apparently inconsistent results we show how a connectionist approach to dyslexic reading development can resolve the paradox a dyslexic model of reading was created by reducing the quality of the phonological representations available to the model during learning the model behaved similarly to dyslexic children in that it had a selectively reduced ability to process nonwords but showed normal effects of words spellingtoound regularity an experimental test of the model predictions confirmed that dyslexic children perform similarly in that they are impaired on irregular words to the same extent as nondyslexic children it is concluded that developmentally dyslexic reading can indeed be understood in terms of impaired phonological representations and that the adoption of a modeling approach resolves an apparent paradox in the experimental literature

262		2007	hardy j shamir j	optics inspired logic architecture	optics express	conventional architectures for the implementation of boolean logic are based on a network of bistable elements assembled to realize cascades of simple boolean logic gates since each such gate has two input signals and only one output signal such architectures are fundamentally dissipative in information and energy their serial nature also induces a latency in the processing time in this paper we present a new principally nondissipative digital logic architecture which mitigates the above impediments unlike traditional computing architectures the proposed architecture involves a  and parallel input scheme where logical functions are evaluated at the speed of light the system is based on digital logic vectors rather than the boolean scalars of electronic logic the architecture employs a novel conception of cascading which utilizes the strengths of both optics and electronics while avoiding their weaknesses it is inherently non dissipative respects the linear nature of interactions in pure optics and harnesses the control advantages of electrons without reducing the speed advantages of optics this new logic paradigm was specially developed with optical implementation in mind however it is suitable for other implementations as well including conventional electronic devices

283		2000	gritsevskyi a nakicenovic n	modeling uncertainty of induced technological change	energy policy	this paper presents a new method for modelinginduced technological learning and uncertainty in energy systems three related features are introduced simultaneously 1 increasing returns to scale for the costs of new technologies 2 clusters of linked technologies that induce learning depending on their technological proximity in addition to the technology relations through the structure and connections of the energy system and 3 uncertain costs of all technologies and energy sources the energy systemsengineering model message developed at iiasa was modified to include these three new features message is a linear programming optimization model the starting point for this new approach was a global ingleregion energy systems version of the message model that includes more than 100 different energy extraction conversion transport distribution and enduse technologies a new feature is that the future costs of all technologies are uncertain and assumed to be  according to the lognormal distribution these are stylized distribution functions that indirectly reflect the cost distributions of energy technologies in the future based on the analysis of the iiasa energy technology inventory in addition the expected value of these cost distributions is assumed to decrease and variance to narrow with the increasing application of new technologies this means that the process of technological learning is uncertain even as cumulative experience increases new technologies include for example fuel cells photovoltaic and wind energy conversion technologies the technologies are related through the structure of energy system in message for example cheaper wind energy has direct and indirect effects on other technologies that produce electricity uptream and on electric enduse technologies downstream in addition technologies are grouped into clusters that depend on technological proximity for example the costs of all fuel cells for mobile applications are a function of their combined installed capacity weighted according to their expected unit sizes this relationship depends on how closely the technologies are related this varying degree of collective technological learning for technologies belonging to the same cluster is also uncertain each scenario of alternative future developments for a deterministic version of the global energy systems model message requires approximately 10 min of cpu time on pc with intel pentium ii 233 mhz and 128 mb of ram therefore it is simply infeasible to generate alternative future developments under uncertainty based on a simple montecarlo type of analysis were one sequentially draws observations from the very large number of more than 200000 cost distributions 100 technologies 11 time steps 10 technological clusters with 22 technologies included assumed here for modeling technological learning and uncertainty instead the new approach proposed here starts with a large but finite number of alternative energy systems technology dynamics and generates in parallel another large but finite number of deterministic scenarios by sampling from the distributions simultaneously for each of these technology dynamics in this application about 130000 scenarios were generated there were 520 alternative technology dynamics each with about 250 alternative deterministic scenarios resulting from the simultaneous stochastic samplings both numbers were initially varied before deciding that about 500 is a sufficient number of different technology dynamics required for a wide spectrum of alternative technological learning possibilities and that about 250 different deterministic scenarios is a sufficient number to generate most of the interesting future energy systems structures for each of the technology dynamics based on the analysis that in total produced roughly one million different scenarios these large numbers of scenarios represent a very small subset of all possible ones that is basically infinite they were not chosen randomly but are a result of applying adaptive global search technique to the formulated nonconvex nonmooth stochastic problem from the 520 alternative technology dynamics about 53 resulted in scenarios with very similar overall energy systems cost they have fundamentally different technological dynamics and produce a wide range of different emergent energy systems but can be considered to be approximately equivalent with respect to optimality criteria in this case simultaneous cost and risk minimization thus one of the results of the analysis is that different structures of energy system emerge with similar overall costs ie that there is a large diversity across alternative energy technology strategies the strategies are path dependent and it is not possible to choose a priori optimal direction of energy systems development another result of the analysis is that the endogenous technology learning with uncertainty and spillover effects have the greatest impact on the emerging structures of energy system during the first few decades of the next century over these intermediate periods of time these two processes create effective lockin effects and increasing returns to adoption in the very long run however all of these effects are not of a great importance the reason is that over such long periods many doubling of capacity of all technologies with inherent leaning occur so that there are few relative cost advantages that result from large investments in some technologies and clusters therefore the main finding is that under uncertainty the nearterm investment decisions in new technologies are more important in determining the direction of longterm development of the energy system than are the decisions that are made later towards the end of the time horizon thus the most dynamic phase in the development of future energy systems occurs during the next few decades it is during this period that there is a high freedom of choice across future technologies and many of these choices lead to high spillover learning effects for related technologies one policy implication that can be made based on the emerging dynamics and different directions of energy systems development in this analysis is that future rdd efforts and investments

431		2014	tani j	selforganization and compositionality in cognitive brains a neurorobotics study	proceedings of the ieee	the most pressing question about cognitive brains is how they support the compositionality that enables combinatorial manipulations of images thoughts and actions when addressing this problem with synthetic modeling the conventional idea prevalent in artificial intelligence and cognitive science generally is to assume hybrid systems and corresponding neural network models where higher order cognition is realized by means of symbolic representation and lower sensorymotor processes by analog processing however the crucial problem with such approaches is that the symbols represented at higher order cognitive levels cannot be grounded naturally in sensorymotor reality the former are defined in a discrete space without any metric and the latter are defined in a continuous space with a physical metric these therefore cannot directly interact with each other regardless of the interface that is assigned between them the proposal in the current paper is to reconstruct higher order cognition by means of continuous neurodynamic systems that can elaborate delicate interactions with the sensorymotor level while sharing the same metric space our neurorobotics experimentsincluding languageaction associations and the learning of goaldirected actionshow that the compositionality necessary for higher order cognitive tasks can be acquired by means of selforganizing dynamic structures via interactive learning between the topdown intentional process of acting on the physical world and the bottomup recognition of perceptual reality using robotic simulations the current paper demonstrates that nonlinear dynamic phenomena such as bifurcations and the chaotic dynamics induced by unstable fixed points could play essential roles in realizing higher order functions

758		2012	adam h galinsky ad	enclothed cognition	journal of experimental social psychology	we introduce the term enclothed cognition to describe the systematic influence that clothes have on the wearer psychological processes we offer a potentially unifying framework to integrate past findings and capture the diverse impact that clothes can have on the wearer by proposing that enclothed cognition involves the cooccurrence of two independent factors the symbolic meaning of the clothes and the physical experience of wearing them as a first test of our enclothed cognition perspective the current research explored the effects of wearing a lab coat a pretest found that a lab coat is generally associated with attentiveness and carefulness we therefore predicted that wearing a lab coat would increase performance on attentionrelated tasks in experiment 1 physically wearing a lab coat increased selective attention compared to not wearing a lab coat in experiments 2 and 3 wearing a lab coat described as a doctor coat increased sustained attention compared to wearing a lab coat described as a painter coat and compared to simply seeing or even identifying with a lab coat described as a doctor coat thus the current research suggests a basic principle of enclothed cognitionit depends on both the symbolic meaning and the physical experience of wearing the clothes

802		2016	iliopoulos a	the material dimensions of signification rethinking the nature and emergence of semiosis in the debate on human origins	quaternary international	the nature and emergence of ymbolic material culture has long been at the forefront of the debate on modern human origins for most evolutionary archaeologists material signs are arbitrary artefacts that were produced by predefined brainbound representations in reducing however material signification to linguistic terms and attributing its creation to a representational mechanism the ymbolic paradigm commits a pair of serious category mistakes for one the significative meaning of material culture is not entirely arbitrary because concepts can actually be founded on physical properties and affordances moreover material signification is not the epiphenomenal product of innate cognitive modules for the mind is not a  device that processes internal representations before externalising them through behaviour in this paper i suggest that these theoretical fallacies about the nature and emergence of material signification can be overcome by combining a pragmatic semiotic theory with an  theory of cognition briefly put a pragmatic semiotic theory describes the nature of material signification by recognising that significative concepts can be founded on physical qualities and relations whereas an  theory of cognition accounts for the emergence of material signification by explaining how significative concepts are brought forth through the constitutive entwinement of mind and matter through the synergistic fusion of these theoretical tenets the origins of material signification can be examined from an ontological perspective that treats the generation of significative meaning as the emergent product of material engagement in its light the preoccupation of most evolutionary archaeologists with the notion of modernity appears to be inherently problematic it is therefore ultimately proposed that the dominant symbolic interpretation of material signification need be replaced with a pragmatic and  theory of cognitive semiotics that is suitably geared to trace the evolution of prehistoric material signs
