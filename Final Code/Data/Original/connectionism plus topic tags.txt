TI The empirical case for two systems of reasoning
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB Distinctions have been proposed between systems of reasoning for centuries. This article distills properties shared by many of these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system is associative because its computations reflect similarity structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is ''rule based'' because it operates on symbolic structures that have logical content and variables and because its computations have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of the distinction and its characterization.

TI NEURAL NETWORKS AND THE BIAS VARIANCE DILEMMA
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB Feedforward neural networks trained by error backpropagation are examples of nonparametric regression estimators.  We present a tutorial on nonparametric inference and its relation to neural networks, and we use the statistical viewpoint to highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural models.  We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals.  In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feed-forward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues.  Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se.  This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals.

TI MODELS OF READING ALOUD - DUAL-ROUTE AND PARALLEL-DISTRIBUTED-PROCESSING
   APPROACHES
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB It has often been argued that various facts about skilled reading aloud cannot be explained by any model unless that model possesses a dual-route architecture (lexical and nonlexical routes from print to speech). This broad claim has been challenged by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989, 1990). Their model has but a single route from print to speech, yet, they contend, it can account for major facts about reading that have hitherto been claimed to require a dual-route architecture. The authors identify 6 of these major facts about reading. The 1-route model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland can account for the first of these but not the remaining 5. Because models with dual-route architectures can explain all 6 of these basic facts about reading, the authors suggest that this remains the viable architecture for any tenable model of skilled reading and learning to read. The dual-route cascaded model, a computational version of the dual-route model, is described.

TI CHARACTERISTICS OF DISSOCIABLE HUMAN LEARNING-SYSTEMS
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB A number of ways of taxonomizing human learning have ben proposed.  We examine the evidence for one such proposal, namely, that there exist independent explicit and implicit learning systems. This combines two further distinctions, (1) between learning that takes place with versus without concurrent awareness, and (2) between learning that involves the encoding of instances (or fragments) versus the induction of abstract rules or hypotheses.  Implicit learning is assumed to involve unconscious rule learning. We examine the evidence for implicit learning derived from subliminal learning, conditioning, artificial grammar learning, instrumental learning, and reaction times in sequence learning.  We conclude that unconscious learning has not been satisfactorily established in any of these areas.  The assumption that learning in some of theses tasks (e.g., artificial grammar learning) is predominantly based on rule abstraction is questionable.  When subjects cannot report the ''implicitly learned'' rules that govern stimulus selection, this is often because their knowledge consists of instances or fragments of the training stimuli rather than rules.  In contrast to the distinction between conscious and unconscious learning, the distinction between instance and rule learning is a sound and meaningful way of taxonomizing human learning.  We discuss various computational models of these two forms of learning.

TI Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and
   nonhuman minds
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Over the last quarter century, the dominant tendency in comparative cognitive psychology has been to emphasize the similarities between human and nonhuman minds and to downplay the differences as "one of degree and not of kind" (Darwin 1871). In the present target article, we argue that Darwin was mistaken: the profound biological continuity between human and nonhuman animals masks an equally profound discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. To wit, there is a significant discontinuity in the degree to which human and nonhuman animals are able to approximate the higher-order, systematic, relational capabilities of a physical symbol system (PSS) (Newell 1980). We show that this symbolic-relational discontinuity pervades nearly every domain of cognition and runs much deeper than even the spectacular scaffolding provided by language or culture alone can explain. We propose a representational-level specification as to where human and nonhuman animals' abilities to approximate a PSS are similar and where they differ. We conclude by suggesting that recent symbolic-connectionist models of cognition shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie the gap between human and nonhuman minds.

TI FROM SIMPLE ASSOCIATIONS TO SYSTEMATIC REASONING - A CONNECTIONIST
   REPRESENTATION OF RULES, VARIABLES AND DYNAMIC BINDINGS USING TEMPORAL
   SYNCHRONY
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Human agents draw a variety of inferences effortlessly, spontaneously, and with remarkable efficiency - as though these inferences were a reflexive response of their cognitive apparatus. Furthermore, these inferences are drawn with reference to a large body of background knowledge. This remarkable human ability seems paradoxical given the complexity of reasoning reported by researchers in artificial intelligence. It also poses a challenge for cognitive science and computational neuroscience: How can a system of simple and slow neuronlike elements represent a large body of systemic knowledge and perform a range of inferences with such speed? We describe a computational model that takes a step toward addressing the cognitive science challenge and resolving the artificial intelligence paradox. We show how a connectionist network can encode millions of facts and rules involving n-ary predicates and variables and perform a class of inferences in a few hundred milliseconds. Efficient reasoning requires the rapid representation and propagation of dynamic bindings. Our model (which we refer to as SHRUTI) achieves this by representing (1) dynamic bindings as the synchronous firing of appropriate nodes, (2) rules as interconnection patterns that direct the propagation of rhythmic activity, and (3) long-term facts as temporal pattern-matching subnetworks. The model is consistent with recent neurophysiological evidence that synchronous activity occurs in the brain and may play a representational role in neural information processing. The model also makes specific psychologically significant predictions about the nature of reflexive reasoning. It identifies constraints on the form of rules that may participate in such reasoning and relates the capacity of the working memory underlying reflexive reasoning to biological parameters such as the lowest frequency at which nodes can sustain synchronous oscillations and the coarseness of synchronization.

TI OVERREGULARIZATION IN LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION
SO MONOGRAPHS OF THE SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AB Children extend regular grammatical patterns to irregular words, resulting in overregularizations like comed, often after a period of correct performance ("U-shaped development"). The errors seem paradigmatic of rule use, hence bear on central issues in the psychology of rules: how creative rule application interacts with memorized exceptions in development, how overgeneral rules are unlearned in the absence of parental feedback, and whether cognitive processes involve explicit rules or parallel distributed processing (connectionist) networks. We remedy the lack of quantitative data on overregularization by analyzing 11,521 irregular past tense utterances in the spontaneous speech of 83 children. Our findings are as follows. (1) Overregularization errors are relatively rare (median 2.5% of irregular past tense forms), suggesting that there is no qualitative defect in children's grammars that must be unlearned. (2) Overregularization occurs at a roughly constant low rate from the 2s into the school-age years, affecting most irregular verbs. (3) Although overregularization errors never predominate, one aspect of their purported U-shaped development was confirmed quantitatively: an extended period of correct performance precedes the first error. (4) Overregularization does not correlate with increases in the number or proportion of regular verbs in parental speech, children's speech, or children's vocabularies. Thus, the traditional account in which memory operates before rules cannot be replaced by a connectionist alternative in which a single network displays rotelike or rulelike behavior in response to changes in input statistics. (5) Overregularizations first appear when children begin to mark regular verbs for tense reliably (i.e., when they stop saying Yesterday I walk). (6) The more often a parent uses an irregular form, the less often the child overregularizes it. (7) Verbs are protected from overregularization by similar-sounding irregulars, but they are not attracted to overregularization by similar-sounding regulars, suggesting that irregular patterns are stored in an associative memory with connectionist properties, but that regulars are not. We propose a simple explanation. Children, like adults, mark tense using memory (for irregulars) and an affixation rule that can generate a regular past tense form for any verb. Retrieval of an irregular blocks the rule, but children's memory traces are not strong enough to guarantee perfect retrieval. When retrieval fails, the rule is applied, and overregularization results.

TI KNOWLEDGE-BASED MODELING OF MATERIAL BEHAVIOR WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS-ASCE
AB To date, material modeling has involved the development of mathematical models of material behavior derived from human observation of, and reasoning with, experimental data.  An alternative, discussed in this paper, is to use a computation and knowledge representation paradigm, called neural networks, developed by researchers in connectionism (a subfield of artificial intelligence) to model material behavior.  The main benefits in using a neural-network approach are that all behavior can be represented within a unified environment of a neural network and that the network is built directly from experimental data using the self-organizing capabilities of the neural network, i.e., the network is presented with the experimental data and "learns" the relationships between stresses and strains.  Such a modeling strategy has important implications for modeling the behavior of modern, complex materials, such as composites.  In this paper, the behaviors of concrete in the state of plane stress under monotonic biaxial loading and compressive uniaxial cycle loading are modeled with a back-propagation neural network.  The preliminary results of using neural networks to model materials look very promising.

TI KNOWLEDGE-BASED ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and a set of classified examples to develop a method for accurately classifying examples not seen during training. The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source. By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources. KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques. It maps problem-specific ''domain theories'', represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation. KBANN is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology. Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by KBANN generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.

TI German inflection: The exception that proves the rule
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB Language is often explained as the product of generative rules and a memorized lexicon. For example, most English verbs take a regular past tense suffix (ask-asked), which is applied to new verbs (faxed, wugged), suggesting the mental rule ''add-ed to a Verb.'' Irregular verbs (break-broke, go-went) would be listed in memory. Alternatively, a pattern associator memory (such as a connectionist network) might record all past tense forms and generalize to new ones by similarity; irregular and regular patterns would differ only because of their different numbers of verbs. We present evidence that mental rules are indispensible. A rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs, so it does not require access to memorized verbs or their sound patterns, but applies as the ''default,'' whenever memory access fails. We find 21 such circumstances for regular past tense formation, including novel, unusual-sounding, and rootless and headless derived words; in every case, people inflect them regularly (explaining quirks like flied out, sabre-tooths, walkmans). Contrary to the connectionist account, these effects are not due to regular words constituting a large majority of vocabulary. The German participle -t applies to a much smaller percentage of verbs than its English counterpart, and the German plural -s applies to a small minority of nouns. Bur the affixes behave in the language like their English counterparts, as defaults. We corroborate this effect in two experiments eliciting ratings of participle and plural forms of novel German words. Thus default suffixation is not due to numerous regular words reinforcing a pattern in associative memory. Because default cases do not occupy a cohesive similarity space, but do correspond to the range of a symbol, they are evidence for a memory-independent, symbol-concatenating mental operation.

AB We present a new distributed connectionist model of the perception of spoken words. The model employs a representation of speech that combines lexical information with abstract phonological information, with lexical access modelled as a direct mapping onto this single distributed representation. We first examine the integration of partial cues to phonological identity, showing that the model provides a sound basis for simulating phonetic and lexical decision data from Marslen-Wilson and Warren (1994). We then investigate the time course of lexical access, and argue that the process of competition between word candidates during lexical access can be interpreted in terms of interference between distributed lexical representations. The relation between our model and other models of spoken word recognition is discussed.

TI SELF-IMPROVING REACTIVE AGENTS BASED ON REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, PLANNING

AB To date, reinforcement learning has mostly been studied solving simple learning tasks. Reinforcement learning methods that have been studied so far typically converge slowly. The purpose of this work is thus twofold: 1) to investigate the utility of reinforcement learning in solving much more complicated learning tasks than previously studied, and 2) to investigate methods that will speed up reinforcement learning.
   This paper compares eight reinforcement learning frameworks: adaptive heuristic critic (AHC) learning due to Sutton, Q-learning due to Watkins, and three extensions to both basic methods for speeding up learning. The three extensions are experience replay, learning action models for planning, and teaching. The frameworks were investigated using connectionism as an approach to generalization. To evaluate the performance of different frameworks, a dynamic environment was used as a testbed. The environment is moderately complex and nondeterministic. This paper describes these frameworks and algorithms in detail and presents empirical evaluation of the frameworks.

SO TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES
AB Dynamical ideas are beginning to have a major impact on cognitive science, from foundational debates to daily practice. In this article, I review three contrasting examples of work in this area that address the lexical and grammatical structure of language, Piaget's classic "A-not-B' error, and active categorical perception in an embodied, situated agent. From these three examples, I then attempt to articulate the major differences between dynamical approaches and more traditional symbolic and connectionist approaches. Although the three models reviewed here vary considerable in their details, they share a focus on the unfolding trajectory of a system's state and the internal and external forces that shape this trajectory, rather than the representational content of its constituent states or the underlying physical mechanism that instantiate the dynamics. In some work, this dynamical viewpoint is augmented with a situated and embodied perspective on cognition, forming a promising unified theoretical framework for cognitive science broadly construed.

This target article attempts to articulate and support the dynamical hypothesis. The dynamical hypothesis has two major components: the nature hypothesis (cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis (cognitive agents can be understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to this hypothesis can be rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical systems, and only sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent to which that is true.

TI PREDICTIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC LEARNING WITHIN CAUSAL-MODELS - ASYMMETRIES IN
   CUE COMPETITION
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
AB Several researchers have recently claimed that higher order types of learning, such as categorization and causal induction. can he reduced to lower order associative learning. These claims are based in part on reports of cue competition in higher order learning. apparently analogous to blocking in classical conditioning. Three experiments are reported in which subjects had to learn to respond on the basis of cues that were defined either as possible causes of a common effect (predictive learning) or as possible effects of a common cause (diagnostic learning). The results indicate that diagnostic and predictive reasoning, far from being identical as predicted by associationistic models. are not even symmetrical. Although cue competition occurs among multiple possible causes during predictive learning, multiple possible effects need not compete during diagnostic learning. The results favor a causal-model theory.

TI GENERALIZATION OF REGULAR AND IRREGULAR MORPHOLOGICAL PATTERNS
SO LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES
AB Both regular inflectional patterns (walk-walked) and irregular ones (swing-swung) can be applied productively to novel words (e.g. wug-wugged; spling -splung). Theories of generative phonology attribute both generalisations to rules; connectionist theories attribute both to analogies in a pattern associator network; hybrid theories attribute regular (fully predictable default) generalisations to a rule and irregular generalisations to a rote memory with pattern-associator properties. In three experiments and three simulations, we observe the process of generalising morphological patterns in humans and two-layer connectionist networks. Replicating Bybee and Moder (1983), we find that people's willingness to generalise from existing irregular verbs to novel ones depends on the global similarity between them (e.g. spling is readily inflectable as splung, but nist is not inflectable as nust). In contrast, generalisability of the regular suffix does not appear to depend on similarity to existing regular verbs: Regularly suffixed versions of both common-sounding plip and odd-sounding ploamph were reliably produced and highly rated, and the odd-sounding verbs were not rated as having worse past-tense forms, relative to the naturalness of their stems, than common-sounding ones. In contrast, Rumelhart and McClelland's connectionist past-tense model was found to vary strongly in its tendency to supply both irregular and regular inflections to these novel items as a function of their similarity to forms it was trained on, and for the dissimilar forms, successful regular inflection rarely occurred. We suggest that rule-only theories have trouble explaining patterns of irregular generalisations, whereas single-network theories have trouble explaining regular ones; the computational demands of the two kinds of verbs are different, so a modular system is optimal for handling both simultaneously. Evidence from linguistics and psycholinguistics independently calls for such a hybrid, where irregular pairs are stored in a memory system that superimposes phonological forms, fostering generalisation by analogy, and regulars are generated by a default suffix concatenation process capable of operating on any verb, regardless of its sound.

SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB The authors present a theory of how relational inference and generalization can be accomplished within a cognitive architecture that is psychologically and neurally realistic. Their proposal is a form of symbolic connectionism: a connectionist system based on distributed representations of concept meanings, using temporal synchrony to bind fillers and roles into relational structures. The authors present a specific instantiation of their theory in the form of a computer simulation model, Learning and Inference with Schemas and Analogies (LISA). By using a kind of self-supervised learning, LISA can make specific inferences and form new relational generalizations and can hence acquire new schemas by induction from examples. The authors demonstrate the sufficiency of the model by using it to simulate a body of empirical phenomena concerning analogical inference and relational generalization.

TI Infant artificial language learning and language acquisition
SO TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES
AB The rapidity with which children acquire language is one of the mysteries of human cognition. A view held widely for the past 30 years is that children master language by means of a language-specific learning device. An earlier proposal, which has generated renewed interest, is that children make use of domain-general. associative learning mechanisms. However, our current lack of knowledge of the actual reaming mechanisms involved during infancy makes it difficult to determine the relative contributions of innate and acquired knowledge. A recent approach to studying this problem exposes infants to artificial languages and assesses the resulting learning. In this article, we review studies using this paradigm that have led to a number of exciting discoveries regarding the learning mechanisms available during infancy. These studies raise important issues with respect to whether such mechanisms are general or specific to language, the extent to which they reflect statistical learning versus symbol manipulation, and the extent to which suck mechanisms change with development. The fine-grained characterizations of infant learning mechanisms that this approach permits should result in a better understanding of the relative contributions of, and the dynamic between, innate and learned factors in language acquisition.

TI THE INDUCTION OF DYNAMIC RECOGNIZERS
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB A higher order recurrent neural network architecture learns to recognize and generate languages after being "trained" on categorized exemplars.  Studying these networks from the perspective of dynamical systems yields two interesting discoveries:  First, a longitudinal examination of the learning process illustrates a new form of mechanical inference:  Induction by phase transition.  A small weight adjustment causes a "bifurcation" in the limit behavior of the network.  This phase transition corresponds to the onset of the network's capacity for generalizing to arbitrary-length strings.  Second, a study of the automata resulting from the acquisition of previously published training sets indicates that while the architecture is not guaranteed to find a minimal finite automaton consistent with the given exemplars, which is an NP-Hard problem, the architecture does appear capable of generating non-regular languages by exploiting fractal and chaotic dynamics.  I end the paper with a hypothesis relating linguistic generative capacity to the behavioral regimes of non-linear dynamical systems.

TI What do connectionism and social psychology offer each other?
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Social psychologists can benefit from exploring connectionist or parallel distributed processing models of mental representation and process and also can contribute much to connectionist theory in return. Connectionist models involve many simple processing units that send activation signals over connections. At an abstract level, the models can be described as representing concepts (as distributed patterns of activation), operating like schemas to fill in typical values for input information, reconstructing memories based on accessible knowledge rather than retrieving static representations, using flexible and context-sensitive concepts, and computing by satisfying numerous constraints in parallel. This article reviews open questions regarding connectionist models and concludes that social psychological contributions to such topics as cognition-motivation interactions may be important for the development of integrative connectionist models.

TI THE REPRESENTATION OF EGOCENTRIC SPACE IN THE POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is the most likely site where egocentric spatial relationships are represented in the brain. PPC cells receive visual, auditory, somaesthetic, and vestibular sensory inputs; oculomotor, head, limb, and body motor signals; and strong motivational projections from the limbic system. Their discharge increases not only when an animal moves towards a sensory target, but also when it directs its attention to it. PPC lesions have the opposite effect: sensory inattention and neglect. The PPC does not seem to contain a "map" of the location of objects in space but a distributed neural network for transforming one set of sensory vectors into other sensory reference frames or into various motor coordinate systems. Which set of transformation rules is used probably depends on attention, which selectively enhances the synapses needed for making a particular sensory comparison or aiming a particular movement.

TI SYMBOLIC AND NEURAL LEARNING ALGORITHMS - AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON
SO MACHINE LEARNING
AB Despite the fact that many symbolic and neural network (connectionist) learning algorithms address the same problem of learning from classified examples, very little is known regarding their comparative strengths and weaknesses.  Experiments comparing the ID3 symbolic learning algorithm with the perceptron and backpropagation neural learning algorithms have been performed using five large, real-world data sets.  Overall, backpropagation performs slightly better than the other two algorithms in terms of classification accuracy on new examples, but takes much longer to train.  Experimental results suggest that backpropagation can work significantly better on data sets containing numerical data.  Also analyzed empirically are the effects of (1) the amount of training data, (2) imperfect training examples, and (3) the encoding of the desired outputs.  Backpropagation occasionally outperforms the other two systems when given relatively small amounts of training data.  It is slightly more accurate than ID3 when examples are noisy or incompletely specified.  Finally, backpropagation more effectively utilizes a "distributed" output encoding.

TI REPRESENTATIONAL CONTENT IN HUMANS AND MACHINES
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB This article focuses on the problem of representational content. Accounting for representational content is the central issue in contemporary naturalism: it is the major remaining task facing a naturalistic conception of the world. Representational content is also the central barrier to contemporary cognitive science and artificial intelligence: it is not possible to understand representation in animals nor to construct machines with genuine representation given current (lack of) understanding of what representation is. An elaborated critique is offered to current approaches to representation, arguing that the basic underlying approach is, at root, logically incoherent, and, thus, that standard approaches are doomed to failure. An alternative model of representation-interactivism-is presented that avoids or solves the problems facing standard approaches. Interactivism is framed by a version of functionalism, and a naturalization of that functionalism completes an outline of a naturalization of representation and representational content.

TI Rules vs. analogy in English past tenses: a computational/experimental
   study
SO COGNITION
AB Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., & Prince, A. (1998). On language and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73-193) posits that speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new "wug test" data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modelling parsing constraints with high-dimensional context space
SO LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES
AB Deriving representations of meaning has been a long-standing problem in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. The lack of a model for representing semantic and grammatical knowledge has been a handicap in attempting to model the effects of semantic constraints in human syntactic processing. A computational model of high-dimensional context space, the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL), is presented with a series of simulations modelling a variety of human empirical results. HAL learns its representations from the unsupervised processing of 300 million words of conversational text. We propose that HAL's high-dimensional context space can be used to (1) provide a basic categorisation of semantic and grammatical concepts, (2) model certain aspects of morphological ambiguity in verbs, and (3) provide an account of semantic context effects in syntactic processing. We propose that the distributed and contextually derived representations that HAL acquires provide a basis for the subconceptual knowledge that can be used in accounting for a diverse set of cognitive phenomena.

TI Coordinating perceptually grounded categories through language: A case
   study for colour
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB This article proposes a number of models to examine through which mechanisms a population of autonomous agents could arrive at a repertoire of perceptually grounded categories that is sufficiently shared to allow successful communication. The models are inspired by the main approaches to human categorisation being discussed in the literature: nativism, empiricism, and culturalism. Colour is taken as a case study Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be. Specifically, we argue that the collective choice of a shared repertoire must integrate multiple constraints, including constraints coining from communication.

TI A probabilistic constraints approach to language acquisition and
   processing
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB This article provides an overview of a probabilistic constraints framework for thinking about language acquisition and processing. The generative approach attempts to characterize knowledge of language (i.e., competence grammar) and then asks how this knowledge is acquired and used. Our approach is performance oriented: the goal is to explain how people comprehend and produce utterances and how children acquire this skill. Use of language involves exploiting multiple probabilistic constraints over various types of linguistic and nonlinguistic information. Acquisition is the process of accumulating this information, which begins in infancy. The constraint satisfaction processes that ore central to language use are the same as the bootstrapping processes that provide entry to language for the child. Framing questions about acquisition in terms of models of adult performance unifies the two topics under a set of common principles and has important consequences for arguments concerning language learnability.

TI New concepts in surgery of WHO grade II gliomas: functional brain
   mapping, connectionism and plasticity - a review
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB Despite a recent literature supporting the impact of surgery on the natural history of low-grade glioma (LGG), the indications of resection still remain a matter of debate, especially because of the frequent location of these tumors within eloquent brain areas - thus with a risk to induce a permanent postoperative deficit. Therefore, since the antagonist nature of this surgery is to perform the most extensive glioma removal possible, while preserving the function and the quality of life, new concepts were recently applied to LGG resection in order to optimize the benefit/risk ratio of the surgery. First, due to the development of functional mapping methods, namely perioperative neurofunctional imaging and intrasurgical direct electrical stimulation, the study of cortical functional organization is currently possible for each patient - in addition to an extensive neuropsychological assessment. Such knowledge is essential because of the inter-individual anatomo-functional variability, increased in tumors due to cerebral plasticity phenomena. Thus, brain mapping enables to envision and perform a resection according to individual functional boundaries. Second, since LGG invades not only cortical but also subcortical structures, and shows an infiltrative progression along the white matter tracts, new techniques of anatomical tracking and functional mapping of the subcortical white matter pathways were also used with the goal to study the individual effective connectivity - which needs imperatively to be preserved during the resection. Third, the better understanding of brain plasticity mechanisms, induced both by the slow-growing LGG and by the surgery itself, were equally studied in each patient and applied to the surgical strategy by incorporating individual dynamic potential of reorganization into the operative planning. The integration of these new concepts of individual functional mapping, connectivity and plastic potential to the surgery of LGG has allowed an extent of surgical indications, an optimization of the quality of resection (neuro-oncological benefit), and a minimization of the risk of sequelae (benefit on the quality of life). In addition, such a strategy has also fundamental applications, since it represents a new door to the connectionism and cerebral plasticity.

TI DOING WITHOUT REPRESENTING
SO SYNTHESE
AB Connectionism and classicism, it generally appears, have at least this much in common:  both place some notion of internal representation at the heart of a scientific study of mind.  In recent years, however, a much more radical view has gained increasing popularity.  This view calls into question the commitment to internal representation itself.  More strikingly still, this new wave of anti-representationalism is rooted not in 'armchair' theorizing but in practical attempts to model and understand intelligent, adaptive behavior.  In this paper we first present, and then critically assess, a variety of recent anti-representationalist treatments.  We suggest that so far, at least, the sceptical rhetoric outpaces both evidence and argument.  Some probable causes of this premature scepticism are isolated.  Nonetheless, the anti-representationalist challenge is shown to be both important and progressive insofar as it forces us to see beyond the bare representational/non-representational dichotomy and to recognize instead a rich continuum of degrees and types of representationality.

TI Modeling option and strategy choices with connectionist networks:
   Towards an integrative model of automatic and deliberate decision making
SO JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING
AB We claim that understanding human decisions requires that both automatic and deliberate processes be considered. First, we sketch the qualitative differences between two hypothetical processing systems, an automatic and a deliberate system. Second, we show the potential that connectionism offers for modeling processes of decision making and discuss some empirical evidence. Specifically, we posit that the integration of information and the application of a selection rule are governed by the automatic system. The deliberate system is assumed to be responsible for information search, inferences and the modification of the network that the automatic processes act on. Third, we critically evaluate the multiple-strategy approach to decision making. We introduce the basic assumption of an integrative approach stating that individuals apply an all-purpose rule for decisions but use different strategies for information search. Fourth, we develop a connectionist framework that explains the interaction between automatic and deliberate processes and is able to account for choices both at the option and at the strategy level.

TI Rethinking eliminative connectionism
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
CT 1996 Edinburgh Conference on Evolution and Language
CY 1996
CL EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND
AB Humans routinely generalize universal relationships to unfamiliar instances. If we are told "if glork then frum," and "glork," we can infer "frum"; any name that serves as the subject of a sentence can appear as the object of a sentence. These universals are pervasive in language and reasoning. One account of how they are generalized holds that humans possess mechanisms that manipulate symbols and variables; an alternative account holds that symbol-manipulation can be eliminated from scientific theories in favor of descriptions couched in terms of networks of interconnected nodes. Can these "eliminative" connectionist models offer a genuine alternative? This article shows that eliminative connectionist models cannot account for how we extend universals to arbitrary items. The argument runs as follows. First, if these models, as currently conceived, were to extend universals to arbitrary instances, they would have to generalize outside the space of training examples. Next, it is shown that the class of eliminative connectionist models that is currently popular cannot learn to extend universals outside the training space. This limitation might be avoided through the use of an architecture that implements symbol manipulation. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Three experiments investigated performance for words which differ from another word only by the transposition of two letters (e.g., salt, slat). In Experiment 1, high frequency words from transposed-letter (TL) confusable pairs were responded to more slowly than carefully matched control words in both the lexical decision and word naming task. Low frequency TL words were responded to less accurately than control words in the naming but not the lexical decision task. Experiment 2 replicated the naming data of Experiment 1 and also revealed that naming accuracy for TL word targets was reduced when they were preceded by a brief masked presentation of their confusable mate. Experiment 3 provided a third replication of the impaired naming performance for TL target words and demonstrated that the effect was insensitive to concurrent dual task demands. These TL confusability effects provide strong constraints that can contribute to evaluation and specification of current models of visual word recognition. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB A number of theoretical positions in psychology-including variants of case-based reasoning, instance-based analogy, and connectionist models-maintain that rules are not involved in human reasoning, or at best play a minor role. Other views hold that the use of abstract rules is a core aspect of human reasoning. We propose eight criteria for determining whether or not people use abstract rules in reasoning, and examine evidence relevant to each criterion for several rule systems. We argue that there is substantial evidence that several different inferential rules, including modus ponens, contractual rules, causal rules, and the law of large numbers, are used in solving everyday problems. We discuss the implications for various theoretical positions and consider hybrid mechanisms that combine aspects of instance and rule models.

This article begins by observing that the finding of a general factor of intelligence appears to be inconsistent with current findings in neuroscience and cognitive science, where specific connections are argued to be critical for different intellectual abilities and the brain is argued to develop these connections in response to environmental stimuli. However, it is then observed that if people differed in neural plasticity, or the ability to adapt their connections to the environment, then those highly developed in one intellectual ability would be highly developed in other intellectual abilities as well. Simulations are then used to confirm that such a pattern would be obtained. Such a model is also shown to account fur many other findings in the field of intelligence that are currently unexplained. A critical period for intellectual development is then emphasized.

By sociocognitive, I mean a view of language and language acquisition as simultaneously occurring and interactively constructed both "in the head" and "in the world."

Second, I describe the cognitive nature of language and its acquisition, focusing especially on recent developments in connectionism. Third, I introduce sociocognitive views of language and posit a social interpretation of connectionism as bridging the gap between cognition and social action. Fourth, I discuss sociocognitive perspectives on first language acquisition. Fifth, I describe the cognitivist biases of much SLA research, then suggest how sociocognitive approaches can help overcome them. I end by considering implications of the perspective I develop in this paper.

TI PRECIS OF BEYOND MODULARITY - A DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE ON COGNITIVE
   SCIENCE
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Beyond modularity attempts a synthesis of Fodor's anticonstructivist nativism and Piaget's antinativist constructivism. Contra Fodor, I argue that: (1) the study of cognitive development is essential to cognitive science, (2) the module/central processing dichotomy is too rigid, and (3) the mind does not begin with prespecified modules; rather, development involves a gradual process of ''modularization.'' Contra Piaget, I argue that: (1) development rarely involves stagelike domain-general change and (2) domain-specific predispositions give development a small but significant kickstart by focusing the infant's attention on proprietary inputs. Development does not stop at efficient learning. A fundamental aspect of human development (''representational redescription'') is the hypothesized process by which information that is in a cognitive system becomes progressively explicit knowledge to that system. Development thus involves two complementary processes of progressive modularization and progressive ''explicitation.'' Empirical findings on the child as linguist, physicist, mathematician, psychologist, and notator are discussed in support of the theoretical framework. Each chapter concentrates first on the initial state of the infant mind/brain and on subsequent domain-specific learning in infancy and early childhood. It then goes on to explore data on older children's problem solving and theory building, with particular focus on evolving cognitive flexibility. Emphasis is placed throughout on the status of representations underlying different capacities and on the multiple levels at which knowledge is stored and accessible. Finally, consideration is given to the need for more formal developmental models, and a comparison is made between representational redescription and connectionist simulations of development. In conclusion, I consider what is special about human cognition by speculating on the status of representations underlying the structure of behavior in other species.

TI KNOWLEDGE-BASED CONNECTIONISM FOR REVISING DOMAIN THEORIES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS
AB Integration of domain theory into empirical learning is important in building a useful learning system in practical domains since the theory is not always perfect and the data is not always adequate. A novel knowledge-based connectionist model referred to as KBCNN for machine learning is presented. In the KBCNN learning model, useful domain attributes and concepts are first identified and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge, and then the links are weighted properly so as to maintain the semantics. Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form. The domain of molecular genetics has been used to demonstrate the validity of the KBCNN learning model and its superiority over related learning methods.

TI Trading spaces: Computation, representation, and the limits of
   uninformed learning
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Some regularities enjoy only an attenuated existence in a body of training data. These are regularities whose statistical visibility depends on some systematic recoding of the data. The space of possible recodings is, however, infinitely large - its is the space of applicable Turing machines. As a result, mappings that pivot on such attenuated regularities cannot, in general, be found by brute-force search. The class of problems that present such mappings we call the class of ''type-2 problems''. Type-1 problems, by contrast, present tractable problems of search insofar as the relevant regularities can be found by sampling the input data as originally coded. Type-2 problems, we suggest, present neither rare nor pathological cases. They are rife in biologically realistic setting sand in domains ranging from simple animat (simulated animal or autonomous robot) behaviors to language acquisition. Not only are such problems rife - they are standardly solved! This presents a puzzle. How, given the statistical intractability of these type-2 cases, does nature turn the trick? One answer, which we do not pursue, is to suppose that evolution gifts us with exactly the right set of recoding biases so as to reduce specific type-2 problems to (tractable) type-1 mappings. Such a heavy-duty nativism is not doubt sometimes plausible. But we believe there are other, more general mechanisms also at work. Such mechanisms provide general (not task-specific) strategies for managing problems of type-2 complexity. Several such mechanisms are investigated. At the heart of each is a fundamental poly - namely, the maximal exploitation of states of representation already achieved by prior, simpler (type-1) learning so as to reduce the amount of subsequent computational search. Such exploitation both characterizes and helps make unitary sense of a diverse range of mechanisms. These include simple incremental learning (Elman 1993), modular connectionism (Jacobs et al. 1991), and the developmental hypothesis of ''representational redescription'' (Karmiloff-Smith 1979; 1992). In addition, the most distinctive features of human cognition - language and culture - may themselves be viewed as adaptations enabling this representation/computation trade-off to be pursued on an even grander scale.

SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB Two decades of research conducted to date has examined selective visual attention to threat and reward stimuli as a function of individual differences in anxiety using the dot-probe task. The present study tests a connectionist neural-network model of meta-analytic and key individual-study results derived from this literature. Attentional bias for threatening and reward-related stimuli is accounted for by connectionist model implementation of the following clinical psychology and affective neuroscience principles: 1) affective learning and temperament, 2) state and trait anxiety, 3) intensity appraisal, 4) affective chronometry, 5) attentional control, and 6) selective attention training. Theoretical implications for the study of mood and anxiety disorders are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI NONWORD PRONUNCIATION AND MODELS OF WORD RECOGNITION
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Nonword pronunciation is a form of generalization behavior that has been at the center of debates about models of word recognition, the role of rules in explaining behavior, and the adequacy of the parallel distributed processing approach. An experiment yielded data concerning the pronunciation of a large corpus of nonwords. The data were then used to assess 2 models of naming: a model developed by D. C. Plaut and J. L. McClelland (1993), which is similar to the one described by M. S. Seidenberg and J. L. McClelland (1989) but uses improved orthographic and phonological representations, and the grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules of M. Coltheart, B. Curtis, P. Atkins, and M. Haller's (1993) dual-route model. Both models generate plausible nonword pronunciations and match subjects' responses accurately. The dual-route model does so by using rules that generate correct output for most words but mispronounce a significant number of exceptions. The parallel distributed processing model does so by finding a set of weights that allow it to generate correct output for both ''rule-governed'' items and exceptions. Some ways in which the two approaches differ and other issues facing them are also discussed.

TI Decomposition of morphologically complex words in English: evidence from
   event-related brain potentials
SO COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH
AB To explain processing differences between regular (e.g., start/started) and irregular (e.g., think/thought) word formation linguistic models posit either a single mechanism handling both morphological clusters or separate mechanisms for regular and irregular words. The purpose of the present study is to investigate how these processing differences map onto brain processes by assessing electrophysiological effects of English past tense forms, using the repetition priming paradigm. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 59 scalp sites as 19 subjects read stem forms of regular and irregular verbs from a List of 1152 words; the stem forms were either preceded (5-9 intervening items) by their past tense forms (= primed condition) or by past tense forms of unrelated verbs (= unprimed condition). The difference between the ERPs to the primed and unprimed stems was taken as a measure of morphological priming. We found that the ERPs to regular verbs were clearly different from those to irregular verbs: the former were associated with an N400 reduction in the primed condition; primed irregular verb stems, however, showed no such effect. Control conditions demonstrated that the N400 modulation for regular verbs cannot be attributed to formal (i.e., phonological or orthographical) priming. These ERP effects indicate that regular verbs serve as more powerful primes for their corresponding stem forms than irregular past tense forms, suggesting that regular (but not irregular) past tense forms may be decomposed into stem plus affix.

TI Models of the emergence of language
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB Recent work in language acquisition has shown bow linguistic form emerges from the operation of self-organizing systems. The emergentist framework emphasizes ways in which the formal structures of language emerge from the interaction of social patterns, patterns implicit in the input, and pressures arising from general aspects of the cognitive system. Emergentist models have been developed to study the acquisition of auditory and articulatory patterns during infancy and the ways in which the learning of the first words emerges from the linkage of auditory, articulatory and conceptual systems. Neural network models have also been used to study the learning of inflectional markings and basic syntactic patterns, using both neural network modeling and concepts from the study of dynamic systems, it is possible to analyze language learning as the integration of emergent dynamic systems.

TI Composition in Distributional Models of Semantics
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e. g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.

TI Bridging the representational gap in the dynamic systems approach to
   development
SO DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE
AB We describe the relationship between the dynamic systems approach to development and a recent approach to the dynamics of representational states - the dynamic field approach. Both approaches share an emphasis on the concepts of stability (attractor states), instability (especially bifurcations), soft-assembly and flexibility. But the dynamic field approach adds the concept of activation' to capture the strength with which behaviorally relevant information is specified. By explicitly linking these dynamic systems approaches, we allow for more direct comparisons between dynamic systems theory and connectionism. We note three current differences between these two approaches to development: (1) the notion of stability is central to how representational states are conceptualized in the dynamic field approach; (2) the dynamic field approach is more directly concerned with the sensorimotor origins of cognition; and (3) the dynamic approach is less advanced with regard to learning. We conclude that proponents of the two approaches can learn from the respective strengths of each approach. We suspect these differences will largely disappear in the next 20 years.

AB Basic elements of a principle-based approach to model development are presented. The approach is needed to understand the operation of models capable of complex behavior. The use of principles facilitatates both assignment of explanatory credit and blame when testing models and guides refinement of models when they fail. Two types of principles are distinguished: design and system. Design principles relate model behavior to observable human behavior. System principles relate model behavior to assumptions about a model's formal structure (architectural axioms). The use of, and relationship between, such principles is illustrated by building the theoretical framework of resonance (S. Grossberg and G. O. Stone, 1986) through the successive addition of principles.

TI Graded semantic and phonological similarity effects in priming: Evidence
   for a distributed connectionist approach to morphology
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
AB A considerable body of empirical and theoretical research suggests that morphological structure governs the representation of words in memory and that many words are decomposed into morphological components in processing. The authors investigated an alternative approach in which morphology arises from the interaction of semantic and phonological codes. A series of cross-modal lexical decision experiments shows that the magnitude of priming reflects the degree of semantic and phonological overlap between words. Crucially, moderately similar items produce intermediate facilitation (e.g., lately-late). This pattern is observed for word pairs exhibiting different types of morphological relationships, including suffixed-stem (e.g., teacher-teach), suffixed-suffixed (e.g., saintly-sainthood) and prefixed-stem pairs (preheat-heat). The results can be understood in terms of connectionist models that use distributed representations rather than discrete morphemes.

TI Representing properties locally
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB Theories of knowledge such as feature lists, semantic networks, and localist neural nets typically use a single global symbol to represent a property that occurs in multiple concepts. Thus, a global symbol represents maize across HORSE, PONY, and LION. Alternatively, perceptual theories of knowledge, as well as distributed representational systems, assume that properties take different local forms in different concepts. Thus, different local forms of inane exist for HORSE, PONY, and LION, each capturing the specific form that inane takes in its respective concept. Three experiments used the property verification task to assess whether properties are represented globally or locally (e.g., Does a PONY have mane?). If a single global form represents a property, then verifying it in any concept should increase its accessibility and speed its verification later in any other concept Verifying mane for PONY should benefit as much from having verified mane for LION earlier as from verifying inane for HORSE. If properties are represented locally, however, verifying a property should only benefit from verifying a similar form earlier. Verifying inane for PONY should only benefit from verifying mane for HORSE, not from verifying mane for LION. Findings from three experiments strongly supported local property representation and ruled out the interpretation that object similarity was responsible (e.g., the greater overall similarity between HORSE and PONY than between LION and PONY). The findings further suggest that property representation and verification are complicated phenomena, grounded in sensory-motor simulations. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI The Newell Test for a theory of cognition
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Newell (1980; 1990) proposed that cognitive theories be developed in an effort to satisfy multiple criteria and to avoid theoretical myopia. He provided two overlapping lists of 13 criteria that the human cognitive architecture would have to satisfy in order to be functional. We have distilled these into 12 criteria: flexible behavior, real-time performance, adaptive behavior, vast knowledge base, dynamic behavior, knowledge integration, natural language, learning, development, evolution, and brain realization. There would be greater theoretical progress if we evaluated theories by a broad set of criteria such as these and attended to the weaknesses such evaluations revealed. To illustrate how theories can be evaluated we apply these criteria to both classical connectionism (McClelland Rumelhart 1986; Rumelhart & McClelland 1986b) and the ACT-R theory (Anderson & Lebiere 1998). The strengths of classical connectionism on this test derive from its intense effort in addressing empirical phenomena in such domains as language and cognitive development. Its weaknesses derive from its failure to acknowledge a symbolic level to thought. In contrast, ACT-R includes both symbolic and subsymbolic components. The strengths of the ACT-R theory derive from its tight integration of the symbolic component with the subsymbolic component. Its weaknesses largely derive from its failure, as yet, to adequately engage in intensive analyses of issues related to certain criteria on Newell's list.

TI Origins of theory of mind, cognition and communication
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS
AB There has been a revolution in our understanding of infant and toddler cognition that promises to have far-reaching implications for our understanding of communicative and linguistic development. Four empirical findings that helped to prompt this change in theory are analyzed: (a) Intermodal coordination-newborns operate with multimodal information, recognizing equivalences in information across sensory-modalities; (b) Imitation-newborns imitate the lip and tongue movements they see others perform; (c) Memory-young infants form long-lasting representations of perceived events and use these memories to generate motor productions after lengthy delays in novel contexts; (d) Theory of mind-by 18 months of age toddlers have adopted a theory of mind, reading below surface behavior to the goals and intentions in people's actions. This paper examines three views currently being offered in the literature to replace the classical framework of early cognitive development: modularity-nativism connectionism, and theory-theory. Arguments are marshaled to support the "theory-theory" view. This view emphasizes a combination of innate structure and qualitative reorganization in children's thought based on input from the people and things in their culture. It is suggested that preverbal cognition forms a substrate for language acquisition and that analyzing cognition may enhance our understanding of certain disorders of communication.

TI Constructing deterministic finite-state automata in recurrent neural
   networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deteriorating performance when tested on long strings. This deteriorating performance can be attributed to the instability of the internal representation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidal discriminant function together with the recurrent structure contribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, that is, the constructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols, the constructive algorithm generates a ''programmed'' neural network with O(n) neurons and O(mn) weights. We compare our algorithm to other methods proposed in the literature.

TI A constructive approach for finding arbitrary roots of polynomials by

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB This paper proposes a constructive approach for finding arbitrary (real or complex) roots of arbitrary (real or complex) Polynomials by multilayer perceptron network (MLPN) using constrained learning algorithm (CLA), which encodes the a priori information of constraint relations between root moments and coefficients of a polynomial into the usual BP algorithm (BPA). Moreover, the root moment method (RMM) is also simplified into a recursive version so that the computational complexity can be further decreased, which leads the roots of those higher order polynomials to be readily found. In addition, an adaptive learning parameter with the CLA is also proposed in this paper; an initial weight selection method is also given. Finally, several experimental results show that our proposed neural connectionism approaches, with respect to the nonneural ones, are more efficient and feasible in finding the arbitrary roots of arbitrary polynomials.

TI On the Biological Plausibility of Grandmother Cells: Implications for
   Neural Network Theories in Psychology and Neuroscience
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB A fundamental claim associated with parallel distributed processing (PDP) theories of cognition is that knowledge is coded in a distributed manner in mind and brain. This approach rejects the claim that knowledge is coded in a localist fashion, with words, objects, and simple concepts (e.g. "dog"). that is, coded with their own dedicated representations. One of the putative advantages of this approach is that the theories are biologically plausible. Indeed, advocates of the PDP approach often highlight the close parallels between distributed representations learned in connectionist models and neural coding in brain and often dismiss localist (grandmother cell) theories as biologically implausible. The author reviews a range a data that strongly challenge this claim and shows that localist models provide a better account of single-cell recording studies. The author also contrast local and alternative distributed coding schemes (sparse and coarse coding) and argues that common rejection of grandmother cell theories in neuroscience is due to a misunderstanding about how localist models behave. The author concludes that the localist representations embedded in theories of perception and cognition are consistent with neuroscience biology only calls into question the distributed representations Often learned in PDP models.

TI A connectionist theory of phenomenal experience
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB When cognitive scientists apply computational theory to the problem of phenomenal consciousness, as many have been doing recently, there are two fundamentally distinct approaches available. Consciousness is to be explained either in terms of the nature of the representational vehicles the brain deploys or in terms of the computational processes defined over these vehicles. We call versions of these two approaches vehicle and process theories of consciousness, respectively. However, although there may be space for vehicle theories of consciousness in cognitive science, they are relatively rare. This is because of the influence exerted, on the one hand, by a large body of research that purports to show that the explicit representation of information in the brain and conscious experience are dissociable, and on the other, by the classical computational theory of mind - the theory that takes human cognition to be a species of symbol manipulation. Two recent developments in cognitive science combine to suggest that a reappraisal of this situation is in order. First, a number of theorists have recently been highly critical of the experimental methodologies used in the dissociation studies - so critical, in fact, that it is no longer reasonable to assume that the dissociability of conscious experience and explicit representation has been adequately demonstrated. Second, classicism, as a theory of human cognition, is no longer as dominant in cognitive science as it once was. It now has a lively competitor in form of connectionism; and connectionism, unlike classicism, does not have the computational resources to support a robust vehicle theory of consciousness. In this target article we develop and defend this connectionist vehicle theory of consciousness. It takes the form of the following simple empirical hypothesis: phenomenal experience consists of the explicit representation of information in neurally realized parallel distributed processing (PDP) networks. This hypothesis leads us to reassess some common wisdom about consciousness, but, we argue, in fruitful and ultimately plausible ways.

TI High-order and multilayer perceptron initialization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Proper initialization is one of the most important prerequisites for fast convergence of feedforward neural networks like high-order and multilayer perceptrons. This publication aims at determining the optimal variance (or range) for the initial weights and biases, which is the principal parameter of random initialization methods for both types of neural networks, An overview of random weight initialization methods for multilayer perceptrons is presented, These methods are extensively tested using eight real-world benchmark data sets and a broad range of initial weight variances by means of more than 30 000 simulations, in the aim to find the best weight initialization method for multilayer perceptrons. For high-order networks, a large number of experiments (more than 200 000 simulations) was performed, using three weight distributions, three activation functions, several network orders, and the same eight data sets, The results of these experiments are compared to weight initialization techniques for multilayer perceptrons, which leads to the proposal of a suitable initialization method for high-order perceptrons. The conclusions on the initialization methods for both types of networks are justified by sufficiently small confidence intervals of the mean convergence times.

TI Dynamic representations and generative models of brain function
SO BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB The main point made in this article is; that the representational capacity and inherent function of any neuron, neuronal population or cortical area is dynamic and! context-sensitive. This adaptive rand contextual specialisation is mediated by functional integration or interactions among brain systems with a special emphasis on backwards or top-down connections. The critical notion is that neuronal responses, in any given cortical area, can represent different things at different times, Our argument is developed under the perspective of generative models of functional brain architectures, where higher-level systems provide a prediction of the inputs to lower-level regions. Conflict between the two is resolved by changes in the higher-level representations, driven by the resulting error in lower regions, until the mismatch is 'cancelled', In this model the specialisation of any region is determined both by bottom-up driving inputs and by top-down predictions. Specialisation is therefore not an intrinsic property of any region but depends on both forward and backward connections with other areas. Because these other areas have access to the context in which the inputs are generated they are in a position to modulate the selectivity or specialisation of lower areas. The implications for 'classical' models (e,g., classical receptive fields in electrophysiology, classical specialisation in neuroimaging and connectionism in cognitive models) are severe and suggest these models provide incomplete accounts of real brain architectures, Generative models represent a far more plausible framework for understanding selective neurophysiological responses and how representations are constructed in the brain.

SO CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
AB In this article a model is developed, based on neurocomputing, for predicting, with sufficient approximation, the compressive strength of cement conglomerates. First, the principles of connectionism are briefly recalled. Some neural networks are then constructed in which the different mix-design parameters of a variety of cement conglomerates, i.e. the compressive strength, are associated. The experimental data obtained during construction of the 'Alto Sulcis Thermal Power Station' at Portovesme, Italy, were used in the tests. The availability of a substantial amount of data enabled the method to be suitably calibrated and satisfactory results were obtained for evaluating the mechanical properties of different concrete mixes.

TI DO CORTICAL AND BASAL GANGLIONIC MOTOR AREAS USE MOTOR PROGRAMS TO
   CONTROL MOVEMENT
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Prevailing engineering-inspired theories of motor control based on sequential/algorithmic or motor-programming models are difficult to reconcile with what is known about the anatomy and physiology of the motor areas. This is partly because of certain problems with the theories themselves and partly because of features of the cortical and basal ganglionic motor circuits that seem ill-suited for most engineering analyses of motor control. Recent developments in computational neuroscience offer more realistic, that is, connectionist, models of motor processing. The distributed, highly parallel, and nonalgorithmic processes in these models are inherently, self-organizing and hence more plausible biologically than their more traditional algorithmic or motor-programming counterparts. The newer models also have the potential to explain some of the unique features of natural, brain-based motor behavior and to avoid some of the computational dilemmas associated with engineering approaches.

TI LEXICAL ACCESS AND THE BRAIN - ANATOMICAL CONSTRAINTS ON COGNITIVE
   MODELS OF WORD RECOGNITION
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
AB Recent studies in the cognitive psychology of reading and many other skilled performances have been dominated by models inspired by neural connectivity (e.g., McClelland & Rumelhart, 1986). Such models have not yet begun to consider the accumulating evidence of considerable anatomical localization of component cognitive operations in the human brain (e.g., Posner, Petersen, Fox, & Raichle, 1988). In this article we apply anatomical findings to the job of building computational models of visual word recognition. Brain imaging studies already provide important constraints on how lexical access should be defined in terms of isolable encoding operations that compute the visual form, phonology, and semantics of words. Brain imaging studies also speak to issues of modularity versus interaction between these encoding operations, distribution versus localization of processing within the operations, and orchestration of operations to accomplish different word processing tasks. We conclude that a combined cognitive and anatomical analysis may be of considerable benefit in developing more adequate models of human information processing.

TI In defense of representation
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB The computational paradigm, which has dominated psychology and artificial intelligence since the cognitive revolution, has been a source of intense debate. Recently, several cognitive scientists have argued against this paradigm, not by objecting to computation, but rather by objecting to the notion of representation. Our analysis of these objections reveals that it is not the notion of representation per se that is causing the problem, but rather specific properties of representations as they are used in various psychological theories. Our analysis suggests that all theorists accept the idea that cognitive processing involves internal information-carrying states that mediate cognitive processing. These mediating states are a superordinate category of representations. We discuss five properties that can he added to mediating states and examine their importance in various cognitive models. Finally, three methodological lessons are drawn from our analysis and discussion. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI Alternatives to the combinatorial paradigm of linguistic theory based on
   domain general principles of human cognition
SO LINGUISTIC REVIEW
AB It is argued that the principles needed to explain linguistic behavior are domain-general and based on the impact that specific experiences have on the mental organization and representation of language. This organization must be sensitive to both specific information and generalized patterns. In addition, knowledge of language is highly sensitive to frequency of use: frequently-used linguistic sequences become more frequent, more accessible and better integrated. The evidence adduced is mainly from phonology and morphology and addresses the issue of gradience and specificity found in postulated units, categories, and dichotomies such as regular and irregular but the points apply to all levels of linguistic analysis including the syntactic, semantic, and discourse levels. Appropriate models for representing such phenomena are considered, including exemplar models and connectionist models, which are evolving to achieve a better fit with linguistic data. The major criticism of connectionist models often raised from, within the combinatorial paradigm of much existing linguistic theory - that they do not capture free combination' to the extent that rule-based systems do, is regarded as a strength rather than a weakness. Recent connectionist models exhibit greater productivity and systematicity than earlier variants, but still show less uniformity of generalization than combinatorial models do. The remaining non-uniformity that the connectionist models show is appropriate, given that such non-uniformity is the rule in language structure and language behavior.

Contemporary developments in cognitive neuroscience offer possibilities of integrating sophisticated, experimentally informed models of thought and memory with an understanding of dynamically and clinically meaningful processes. Aspects of contemporary theory and research in cognitive neuroscience are integrated with psychoanalytic theory and technique, particularly theories of conflict and compromise. After a description of evolving models of the mind in cognitive neuroscience, several issues relevant to psychoanalytic theory and practice are addressed. These include the nature of representations, the interaction of cognition and affect, and the mechanisms by which the mind unconsciously forges compromise solutions that best fit multiple cognitive and affective-motivational constraints.

TI Rule and analogy mechanisms in reading nonwords: Hough Dou Peapel Rede
   Gnew Wirds?
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE
AB In Experiment 1, participants read a long list of nonwords and made ratings of pronunciation variability. Experiment 2 compared speeded naming of nonwords presented alone or mixed with words. In both experiments, at least 85% of nonwords based on inconsistent word bodies were pronounced according to spelling-sound rules, but regular pronunciations were assigned to only 30-40% of nonwords with no regular word-body neighbors. Contradicting the prediction of parallel-distributed-processing models of nonword naming, the probability of an irregular pronunciation was a function of the proportion of irregular word neighbors, not the frequency of these neighbors. The dual-route cascade model overestimated the proportion of regular nonword pronunciations but successfully predicted the particular nonwords most likely to be pronounced irregularly. These results highlight the issues that must be addressed in future refinements of models of nonword naming.

TI The role of salience in the extraction of algebraic rules
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
AB Recent research suggests that humans and other animals have sophisticated abilities to extract both statistical dependencies and rule-based regularities from sequences. Most of this research stresses the flexibility and generality of such processes. Here the authors take up an equally important project, namely, to explore the limits of such processes. As a case study for rule-based generalizations, the authors demonstrate that only repetition-based structures with repetitions at the edges of sequences (e.g., ABCDEFF but not ABCDDEF) can be reliably generalized, although token repetitions can easily be discriminated at both sequence edges and middles. This finding suggests limits on rule-based sequence learning and new interpretations of earlier work alleging rule learning in infants. Rather than implementing a computerlike, formal process that operates over all patterns equally well, rule-based learning may be a highly constrained and piecemeal process driven by perceptual primitives-specialized type operations that are highly sensitive to perceptual factors.

This article presents several examples that illustrate both rewards and potential hazards associated with the simulation approach. Simulations can provide the formal framework necessary to disambiguate new ideas, they can explore the implications of complex models, and they can predict seemingly counterintuitive findings or uncover hidden relationships. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid pitfalls that may arise when computer code inadvertently differs from the intended specifications of a theory, or when predictions derive not from fundamental properties of a theory but from pragmatic choices made by the modeler.

TI So how Does the mind work ?
SO MIND & LANGUAGE
AB In my book How the Mind Works, I defended the theory that the human mind is a naturally selected system of organs of computation. Jerry Fodor claims that 'the mind doesn't work that way'(in a book with that title) because (1) Turing Machines cannot duplicate humans' ability to perform abduction (inference to the best explanation); (2) though a massively modular system could succeed at abduction, such a system is implausible on other grounds; and (3) evolution adds nothing to our understanding of the mind. In this review I show that these arguments are flawed. First, my claim that the mind is a computational system is different from the claim Fodor attacks (that the mind has the architecture of a Turing Machine); therefore the practical limitations of Turing Machines are irrelevant. Second, Fodor identifies abduction with the cumulative accomplishments of the scientific community over millennia. This is very different from the accomplishments of human common sense, so the supposed gap between human cognition and computational models may be illusory. Third, my claim about biological specialization, as seen in organ systems, is distinct from Fodor's own notion of encapsulated modules, so the limitations of the latter are irrelevant. Fourth, Fodor's arguments dismissing of the relevance of evolution to psychology are unsound.

TI Can connectionism save constructivism?
SO COGNITION
AB Constructivism is the Piagetian notion that learning leads the child to develop new types of representations. For example, on the Piagetian view, a child is born without knowing that objects persist in time even when they are occluded; through a process of learning, the child comes to know that objects persist in time. The trouble with this view has always been the lack of a concrete, computational account of how a learning mechanism could lead to such a change. Recently, however, in a book entitled Rethinking Innateness, Elman et al. (Elman, J.L., Bates, E., Johnson, M.H., Karmiloff-Smith. A., Parisi, D., Plunkett, E;., 1996. Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) have claimed that connectionist models might provide an account of the development of new kinds of representations that would not depend on the existence of innate representations. I show that the models described in Rethinking Innateness depend on innately assumed representations and that they do not offer a genuine alternative to nativism. Moreover, I present simulation results which show that these models are incapable of deriving genuine abstract representations that are not presupposed. I then give a formal account of why the models fail to generalize in the ways that humans do. Thus, connectionism, at least in its current form, does not provide any support for constructivism. I conclude by sketching a possible alternative. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Statistical test of the rule assessment methodology by latent class
   analysis
SO DEVELOPMENTAL REVIEW
AB A problem of Siegler's (1981) rule assessment methodology is that the assignment of subjects to rules takes place by an arbitrary criterion. This problem can be solved by latent class analysis by which we can test statistically how many rules are needed to fit the data and which these rules are. Two data sets of the balance scale test are analyzed, The first empirical data set stems from a study of Van Maanen, Been Bi Sijtsma (1989) and consists of 484 subjects in Grade 7 and Grade 8. The second data set is derived from the simulation of the PDP model of McClelland (1989). According to McClelland and Jenkins (1991), this connectionistic model simulates the saltatory acquisition of rules for tasks like the balance scale. The fit of the latent class models to the empirical data shows that rules can be found, that some are different from the ones Siegler proposes, that the correct rule is not acquired by the subjects in this sample, and that the rules in the transitional period are difficult to identify. The latent class models do not fit the PDP data, indicating that the behavior of the PDP model can not be characterized by rules. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

   principle
SO COGNITION
AB The Hebrew root morpheme typically consists of three consonants. Hebrew allows a gemination of a root consonant, but constrains its location [McCarthy, J. (1979). Formal problems in semitic phonology and morphology. Cambridge, MA; MTT Ph.D. dissertation. Distributed by Indiana University Linguistics Club. Garland Press, New York, 1985], A gemination of a root-consonant is permitted at the end of the root (e.g., [mss]), but not at its beginning (e.g., [ssm]). Two experiments examined readers' sensitivity to the structure of the root morpheme by obtaining ratings for nonwords derived from nonroots. Root-initial gemination (e.g., [ssm]) was judged unacceptable compared to root-final gemination (e.g., [mss]) or no gemination controls (e.g., [psm]). The sensitivity to root structure emerged regardless of the position of the root in the word. These results have several implications. (I) Our findings demonstrate morphological decomposition. Hebrew speakers' ratings reflect a phonological constraint on the location of geminates. Being the domain of this constraint, the root morpheme must form a separate constituent in the representation of Hebrew words. (2) The rejection of root-initial gemination supports the psychological reality of the Obligatory Contour Principle, a pivotal constraint in autosegmental phonology. (3) A sensitivity to the location of geminates presupposes a distinction between the representation of geminate and nongeminate bigrams. Such a distinction, however, requires the implementation of a symbol. Our findings converge with numerous linguistic evidence in suggesting that the representation of constituency structure is necessary to account for linguistic generalizations.

TI Coherence Shifts in Probabilistic Inference Tasks
SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING
AB The fast-and-frugal heuristics approach to probabilistic inference assumes that individuals often employ simple heuristics to integrate cue information that commonly function in a non-reciprocal fashion. Specifically, the subjective validity of a certain cue remains stable during the application of a heuristic and is not changed by the presence or absence of another cue. The parallel constraint satisfaction (PCS) model, in contrast, predicts that information is processed in a reciprocal fashion. Specifically, it assumes that subjective cue validities interactively affect each other and are modified to coherently support the favored choice. Corresponding to the model's simulation, we predicted the direction and the size of such coherence shifts. Cue validities were measured before, after (Experiment 1), and during judgment (Experiments 2 and 3). Coherence shifts were found in environments involving real-world cue knowledge (weather forecasts) and in a domain for which the application of fast-and-frugal heuristics has been demonstrated (city-size tasks). The results indicate that subjective cue validities are not fixed parameters, but that they are interactively changed to form coherent representations of the task.

TI CALM - CATEGORIZING AND LEARNING MODULE
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB A new procedure (CALM:  Categorizing and Learning Module) is introduced for unsupervised learning in modular neural networks.  The work described addresses a number of problems in connectionist modeling, such as lack of speed, lack of stability, inability to learn either with or without supervision, and the inability to both discriminate between and generalize over patterns.  CALM is a single module that can be used to construct larger networks.  A CALM module consists of pairs of excitatory Representation- and inhibitory Veto-nodes, and an Arousal-node.  Because of the fixed internal wiring pattern of a module, the Arousal-node is sensitive to the novelty of the input pattern.  The activation of the Arousal-node determines two psychologically motivated types of learning operating in the module:  elaboration learning, which implies a high learning rate and the distribution of nonspecific, random activations in the module, and activation learning, which has only base rate learning without random activations.  The learning rule used is a modified version of a rule described by Grossberg.  The workings of CALM networks are illustrated in a number of simulations.  It is shown that a CALM module quickly reaches a categorization, even with new patterns.  Though categorization and learning are relatively fast compared to other models, CALM modules do not suffer from excessive plasticity.  They are also shown to be capable of both discriminating between and generalizing over patterns.  When presented with a pattern set exceeding the number of Representation-nodes, similar patterns are assigned to the same node.  Multi-modular simulations showed that with supervised learning an average of 1.6 presentations sufficed to learn the EXOR function.  Moreover, an unsupervised learning version of the McClelland and Rumelhart model successfully simulated a word superiority effect.  It is concluded that the incorporation of psychologically and biologically plausible structural and functional characteristics, like modularity, unsupervised (competitive) learning, and a novelty dependent learning rate, may contribute to solving some of the problems often encountered in connectionist modeling.

TI An ER-fMRI investigation of morphological inflection in German reveals
   that the brain makes a distinction between regular and irregular forms
SO BRAIN AND LANGUAGE
AB The hypothesis that morphological processing is supported by a mental dictionary of stored entries plus a set of mental computations based on rules is examined using event-related fMRI. If a rules-plus-memory model (Pinker, 1999) reflects the actual organization of the language faculty, two distinct patterns of brain activation should be observed for production of German irregular and regular noun and verb inflections. If a connectionist alternative to the rules-and-memory model (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986, and many others since), which seeks to explain the production of both irregular and regular forms within a single associative memory mechanism, is correct, there should be no neural differentiation between German regular and irregular inflection. The results we report support the existence of substantially differing patterns of activation for regulars vs. irregulars, an outcome that is consistent with the two-component rules-plus-memory account.

AB A traditional view of perception and action makes two assumptions: that the causal flow between perception and action is primarily linear or one-way, and that they are merely instrumentally related to each other, so that each is a means to the other. Either or both of these assumptions can be rejected. Behaviorism rejects the instrumental but not the one-way aspect of the traditional view, thus leaving itself open to charges of verificationism. Ecological views reject the one-way aspect but not the instrumental aspect of the traditional view, so that perception and action are seen as instrumentally interdependent. It is argued here that a better alternative is to reject both assumptions, resulting in a two-level interdependence view in which perception and action co-depend on dynamically circular subpersonal relations and as a result may be more than merely instrumentally interdependent. This is illustrated by reference to motor theories of perception and control theories of action.

TI German inflection: Single route or dual route?
SO COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB The German plural system has recently become a focal point for conflicting theories of language, both linguistic and cognitive. Marcus tt al. (1995) highlight the German plural as support for the dual-route account of inflectional morphology first proposed by Pinker and colleagues (Pinker & Prince, 1988). On the dual-route account, inflectional morphology is universally subserved by a symbolic rule route which deals with regular inflection and an associative memory component which deals with irregular inflection. This contrasts with single-route connectionist systems. We seek to counter supposed evidence for the dual-route account through large-scale simulations as well as through experimental data. We argue that, in its current form, the dual-route account is incapable of generating experimental data provided by Marcus et al. (1995) as support. Finally, we provide direct quantitative comparisons between single-route and dual-route models of German plural inflection and find single-route performance superior on these tests, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB An informal, but revisionist, discussion of the role that the concept of a concept plays in recent theories of the cognitive mind. It is argued that the practically universal assumption that concepts are (at least partially) individuated by their roles in inferences is probably mistaken.

TI Applying global workspace theory to the frame problem
SO COGNITION
AB The subject of this article is the frame problem, as conceived by certain cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind, notably Fodor for whom it stands as a fundamental obstacle to progress in cognitive science. The challenge is to explain the capacity of so-called informationally unencapsulated cognitive processes to deal effectively with information from potentially any cognitive domain without the burden of having to explicitly sift the relevant from the irrelevant. The paper advocates a global workspace architecture, with its ability to manage massively parallel resources in the context of a serial thread of computation, as an answer to this challenge. Analogical reasoning is given particular attention, since it exemplifies informational unencapsulation in its most extreme form. Because global workspace theory also purports to account for the distinction between conscious and unconscious information processing, the paper advances the tentative conclusion that consciousness may go hand-in-hand with a solution to the frame problem in the biological brain.

TI Weighted Constraints in Generative Linguistics
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB Harmonic Grammar (HG) and Optimality Theory (OT) are closely related formal frameworks for the study of language. In both, the structure of a given language is determined by the relative strengths of a set of constraints. They differ in how these strengths are represented: as numerical weights (HG) or as ranks (OT). Weighted constraints have advantages for the construction of accounts of language learning and other cognitive processes, partly because they allow for the adaptation of connectionist and statistical models. HG has been little studied in generative linguistics, however, largely due to influential claims that weighted constraints make incorrect predictions about the typology of natural languages, predictions that are not shared by the more popular OT. This paper makes the case that HG is in fact a promising framework for typological research, and reviews and extends the existing arguments for weighted over ranked constraints.

SP PSYCHON SOC
AB Connectionist models have come to play an important role in cognitive science and in cognitive neuroscience, yet their role in explaining behavior is not necessarily obvious and has generated considerable debate. Connectionism is a body of tools and ideas that can be used in different ways. It can be treated as a form of simulation modeling in which the goal is to implement preexisting theories. In this approach, connectionist models function as a kind of statistical tool, a way of analyzing a complex set of data. Connectionism can also be seen as providing a small set of general theoretical principles that apply in a variety of domains. Construed in this way, it contributes to the development of theories that are explanatory, not merely descriptive.

TI Integrating structure and meaning: a distributed model of analogical
   mapping
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB In this paper we present Drama, a distributed model of analogical mapping that integrates semantic and structural constraints on constructing analogies. Specifically, Drama uses holographic reduced representations (Plate, 1994), a distributed representation scheme, to model the effects of structure and meaning on human performance of analogical mapping. Drama is compared to three symbolic models of analogy (SME, Copycat, and ACME) and one partially distributed model (LISA). We describe Drama's performance on a number of example analogies and assess the model in terms of neurological and psychological plausibility. We argue that Drama's successes are due largely to integrating structural and semantic constraints throughout the mapping process. We also claim that Drama is an existence proof of using distributed representations to model high-level cognitive phenomena. (C) 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The case against neuropsychoanalysis - On fallacies underlying
   psychoanalysis' latest scientific trend and its negative impact on
   psychoanalytic discourse
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOANALYSIS
AB The authors offer a critical examination of the claims of the proponents of the growing neuropsychoanalytic trend, that neuroscientific findings are relevant and important for the development and justfication of psychoanalytic theory and practice. They bring to light some of the intuitions that have led to the popularity of the neuropsychoanalytic claims and the fallacies that underlie these claims and intuitions. They argue that it is crucial at this time to articulate the case against the neuropsychoanalytic trend because, underlying the debate over the relevance of neuroscience to psychoanalysis, there lies a struggle over the essential nature of psychoanalytic theory and practice. Relying on a biologistic perspective, whereby only what is biological is real, this new trend in effect offers a vision of psychoanalysis that limits the significance of the unique psychoanalytic concern with the understanding of meanings and the role of discourse in discerning and justifying these meanings.

TI CONNECTIONIST MODELING - IMPLICATIONS FOR COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
SO LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES
AB We review here the logic of neuropsychological inference in the context of connectionist modelling, focusing on the inference from double dissociation to modularity of function. The results of an investigation into the effects of damage on a range of small artificial neural networks that have been trained to perform two distinct mappings (rules vs exceptions), suggest that a double dissociation is possible without modularity. However, when these studies are repeated using sufficiently larger and more distributed networks, which are presumably more psychologically and biologically relevant, double dissociations are not observed. Further analysis suggests that double dissociation between performance on rule-governed and exceptional items is only found when the contribution of individual units to the overall network performance is significant, and hence that such double dissociations are merely artefacts of scale. In large, fully distributed systems, a wide range of damage produces only a single dissociation in which the main regularities are selectively preserved. Thus, in this context, connectionism appears to create no additional problems for the traditional neuropsychological inference.

TI Perceptual constraints and the learnability of simple grammars
SO COGNITION
AB Cognitive processes are often attributed to statistical or symbolic general-purpose mechanisms. Here we show that some spontaneous generalizations are driven by specialized, highly constrained symbolic operations. We explore how two types of artificial grammars are acquired, one based on repetitions and the other on characteristic relations between tones ("ordinal" grammars). Whereas participants readily acquire repetition-based grammars, displaying early electrophysiological responses to grammar violations, they perform poorly with ordinal grammars, displaying no such electrophysiological responses. This outcome is problematic for both general symbolic and statistical models, which predict that both types of grammars should be processed equally easily. This suggests that some simple grammars are acquired using perceptual primitives rather than general-purpose mechanisms; such primitives may be elements of a "toolbox" of specialized computational heuristics, which may ultimately allow constructing a psychological theory of symbol manipulation.
